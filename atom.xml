Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8. Gardening"></a>8. Gardening</h3><p>Gardening is a set of activities that often are mindless. Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12. Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house" class="headerlink" title="14. Clean the house"></a>14. Clean the house</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-12.jpg"                      alt="clean the house podcast"                ></p><p>Again, it all comes down to making a daunting task like cleaning the house fun and entertaining. If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye" class="headerlink" title="15. Haircut or hair dye"></a>15. Haircut or hair dye</h3><p>A haircut is a time that you give to your barber. It is all about sitting on the chair and letting the masters do their work. And putting on earphones for listening to music and podcast can be disastrous, as one snip and your costly earphones will be gone for good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="haircut podcast"                ></p><p>However, you can make the time of everyone sitting at the saloon beautiful by simply asking the barber to play one of the podcasts they like or you like. This will also allow you to experience new podcasts you aren’t familiar with and initiate a good conversation with your client.</p><h2 id="Summing-up"><a href="#Summing-up" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The above list of things to do while listening to podcasts is all about acquainting you with tedious tasks and making them beautiful.</p><p>As mentioned, you can complement a podcast episode with any boring task you have to do daily and make your time most effective and fun.</p><p>Overall, there are too many mindless things that you have to do daily; simply remember to carry your earphones and make that mindless activity into a beautiful, fun, and informative session.</p><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening!

What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?"></a>Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</h2><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button.

How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed. Nevertheless, the process depends on whether you’re using a hosting service or not. Read on to find out how to create an RSS feed with or without a hosting platform;</p><h3 id="Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms"><a href="#Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms"></a>Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</h3><p>As mentioned, once you create an account with a podcast hosting website, your podcast RSS Feed will be automatically created. So you just need to complete your account setup, and once you publish a new podcast episode, you can find the RSS Feed in the relevant section of the podcast hosting platform.</p><p>We used the Castos hosting website to generate a podcast RSS Feed in the steps below;</p><p>Step1 Visit Castos website and set up an account with them.</p><p>Step2 Create a new podcast episode and fill in all necessary details in the relevant boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-3.jpg"                      alt="create a new podcast episode"                ></p><p>Step3 Navigate to the Podcast Setting area and provide your podcast information, such as Title, Description, Cover art, etc. Afterward, click the relevant button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-4.jpg"                      alt="navigate to the podcast setting area"                ></p><p>Step4 Once you successfully save your podcast details and upload the new episode, navigate to the Dashboard and locate your Podcast RSS Feed in the Distribution tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-5.jpg"                      alt="rss feed castos"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform"><a href="#Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform"></a>Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</h3><p>Since the native RSS Feed of a self-hosted website usually contains blog article content, which is not needed in a podcast RSS Feed, you need a plugin like Powerpress to generate your podcast RSS feed.</p><p>The PowerPress plugin allows you to generate RSS feed containing only your podcast audio once you publish new content on your website. The following steps explain the process of creating an RSS feed without a hosting platform;</p><p>Step1 Open WordPress and log in to the backend of your WordPress website.

It lets us look in detail at the things around us and can be an exciting and dramatic way to shoot images. But is there a difference between close up and macro in photography terms?</p><p>There is, so if you’re looking to get to grips with this type of photography, you need to understand that:</p><ul><li><strong>Close up photography</strong> is about putting your iPhone camera physically close to the object you are photographing, but without using any peripherals or special apps.</li><li>**<strong>Macro photography uses technology to actually increase the size of the image to allow a close-up photo without needing to be so physically close.</strong></li></ul><p>With your iPhone macro photography and close-up shooting are both possible and can bring great results if you know what you’re doing.

Early morning and midafternoon are great times of day to plan a shoot, as the soft, natural light is ideal for macro photography. Taking photos in the blazing midday sun can cause overexposure, and your iPhone may struggle to focus too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/close-up-photography-light.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: Urdu-Mag.com</p><p>If you do want to snap some macro images in bright sunlight, try positioning your shadow to create a more indirect lighting of the subject. You can also move your own orientation so that the sun is shining into your shot, rather than behind it.</p><h4 id="Tip2-Focus-is-the-key"><a href="#Tip2-Focus-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="Tip2. Focus is the key"></a>Tip2. Focus is the key</h4><p>With any photo, focus is crucial to an awesome result. But when you’re creating macro images, this becomes even more critical to the success of your photography. Try using the manual focus setting to give yourself more control over your focus point, and work on fine-tuning your skills to create the perfect image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/close-up-photography-focus.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: PicMonkey</p><p>If you’re not ready to go fully manual, you could try using the iPhone’s locking feature to lock the focus into place and avoid the photo being ruined by a little wobble on your part. To use this, simply tap and hold the screen at the part of the image you want to be in focus, and you’ll see AE&#x2F;EF Lock appear at the bottom. This means both focus and lighting are fixed until you tap elsewhere on the screen to release it.</p><h4 id="Tip3-Keep-steady"><a href="#Tip3-Keep-steady" class="headerlink" title="Tip3. Keep steady"></a>Tip3. Keep steady</h4><p>Keeping still when taking a macro shot is absolutely vital. With your image already enlarged, any wobbles or shakes will cause blur or a loss of focus and spoil your image. In the longer term, you may want to invest in a tripod to steady the phone, but if you’re just starting out, you might not be keen just yet.</p><p>If you don’t own a tripod, you could use a stationary object nearby, such as a wall, rock or gate. You could also bring a beanbag with you, as these allow you to get up close and personal with your subject comfortably, whilst also supporting and steadying your phone for the shot.</p><h4 id="Tip4-Don’t-get-too-close"><a href="#Tip4-Don’t-get-too-close" class="headerlink" title="Tip4. Don’t get too close"></a>Tip4. Don’t get too close</h4><p>Hold your finger close to your face, and you’ll find that at a certain distance you can no longer focus on it. The same principle is true for iPhone macro photography; if you get too close your image will start to blur. But how close is too close?</p><p>Different iPhone iterations have slightly different lenses, so there will be a bit of trial and error involved to find the perfect distance for your model. Somewhere in the range of two to four inches tends to be about the limit and is more than close enough to allow you to take some stunning close-up photographs.</p><h4 id="Tip5-Be-simple"><a href="#Tip5-Be-simple" class="headerlink" title="Tip5. Be simple"></a>Tip5. Be simple</h4><p>When you’re shooting macro images with your iPhone, the intention is to make the background somewhat blurry, with only the objects at the front of the image in focus. You might think that this means it doesn’t matter what’s actually in the background, but in reality, a busy background with mixed colors can still serve to spoil your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-photography-distance.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: GCFLearnFree</p><p>Make the subject center stage by positioning your composition to give the least cluttered background possible. Use the sky if you can, or experiment with textured backgrounds such as a wall or fence. Think about how far your subject is from the background, as the further away the background is, the more blurry it will become and the greater the contrast of focus on your subject will appear.</p><h4 id="Tip6-Composition"><a href="#Tip6-Composition" class="headerlink" title="Tip6. Composition"></a>Tip6. Composition</h4><p>If you’ve researched photography in general, you’ll already have heard of the ‘rule of thirds’. This rule is super simple to apply when using an iPhone and is just as relevant in macro photography as it is when shooting landscapes or any other composition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-photography-composition.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: SmashingHub</p><p>The rule states that if the image were divided into thirds horizontally and vertically, the most important objects in the image should be placed at the points where the lines intersect. This is easy on iPhone, as you can switch on the gridlines and instantly see where to place the subject in the photos. When shooting macro images, place your focal point at one of the intersections to give your photo the professional touch.</p><h4 id="Tip7-Try-different-angles"><a href="#Tip7-Try-different-angles" class="headerlink" title="Tip7. Try different angles"></a>Tip7. Try different angles</h4><p>iPhone macro photography is all about looking at the world in a different way. To really accentuate this quality in your work, why not try shooting from a different perspective? Get very low down and shoot your subject from below, with the sky as a background, or snap from directly above to add drama to your images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-photography-angles.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: Flickr</p><p>Look for interesting colors and play with the light. Let the sunshine through the leaves of the plant or find a puddle and play with reflections. Line yourself up with a cityscape or countryside landscape, then place the subject dangling in the foreground. Have fun with angles and discover new ways of looking at your surroundings.</p><h4 id="Tip8-Waterdrop-trick"><a href="#Tip8-Waterdrop-trick" class="headerlink" title="Tip8. Waterdrop trick"></a>Tip8. Waterdrop trick</h4><p>If you’re yet to invest in a macro lens for your iPhone, water can be your friend, adding a new level of magnification to your image. A small drop of water is a powerful magnifier and applying it carefully to your iPhone lens can make close-up photography even better.</p><p>A larger drop that is almost ready to plop off will give magnificent magnification, but you’ll have to have a steady hand and fast shutter finger to enjoy the result. Applying a huge droplet will give a dramatic result, softly blurred at the edges and sharply in focus at the center.</p><p>Do be careful not to soak your iPhone while you’re playing with this trick!</p><h4 id="Tip9-Use-a-macro-lens"><a href="#Tip9-Use-a-macro-lens" class="headerlink" title="Tip9. Use a macro lens"></a>Tip9. Use a macro lens</h4><p>If you’re serious about achieving incredible iPhone macro photography, the very best shots are only possible with a purpose-built macro lens. Simple, clip-on lenses will elevate the results to new heights, letting you take immaculately detailed, super close up shots that look like they were done on an expensive professional camera.</p><p>There are a number of iPhone macro lenses out there that will do a great job and won’t necessarily cost the earth. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.olloclip.com/" >Olloclip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://photojojo.com/" >Photojojo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are both under $100, and let you add the pro touch to every photograph you set up. These are lightweight, easy to fit, and well worth the investment for the keen close up photographer.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>If you’re fed up with the same old shots and want to try something different, delving into the world of macro photography with your iPhone could give you a new lease of life. Whether you dive right in with a purchase of a clip-on lens or simply start looking at the little details in everything around you, close up photography is fun and easy to get into for every iPhone user.</p><p>Explore, experiment, and practice, and you’ll soon find your own style and be the envy of all your followers.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-transforming-media-landscape-an-exclusive-look-at-magix-vpx/"><u>In 2024, Transforming Media Landscape  An Exclusive Look at Magix VPX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/top-10-essential-free-photo-layering-tools-on-iosandroid-for-2024/"><u>Top 10 Essential Free Photo Layering Tools on iOS/Android for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-complete-audio-editors-journey-through-garageband/"><u>[Updated] The Complete Audio Editor's Journey Through GarageBand</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-top-5-mkv-player-picks-for-macos-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] Top 5 MKV Player Picks for macOS Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-tips-for-removing-fisheye-from-gopro-footage/"><u>[Updated] Tips for Removing Fisheye From GoPro Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-platforms-for-animated-3d-creation/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Platforms for Animated 3D Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-uncovering-hidden-wellsprings-of-free-graphic-designs/"><u>[Updated] Uncovering Hidden Wellsprings of Free Graphic Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Samsung Galaxy A14 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-auditory-balance-tips-on-reducing-unwanted-sibilance-and-whistles/"><u>Updated In 2024, Auditory Balance Tips on Reducing Unwanted Sibilance and Whistles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/the-actual-fix-for-exporting-srt-from-premiere-not-working/"><u>The Actual Fix for Exporting SRT From Premiere Not Working</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/2024-approved-zoom-voice-modifiers-6-expert-tips-to-make-every-meeting-unforgettable-and-entertaining/"><u>2024 Approved Zoom Voice Modifiers 6 Expert Tips to Make Every Meeting Unforgettable and Entertaining</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-trade-pokemon-go-from-far-away-on-samsung-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Ways to trade pokemon go from far away On Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-boosting-views-with-analytics-in-youtube-strategy/"><u>[New] Boosting Views with Analytics in YouTube Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-from-script-to-screen-youtube-tutorial-and-alternative-pathways/"><u>[Updated] From Script to Screen  YouTube Tutorial & Alternative Pathways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/elite-8-blu-ray-player-rankings-for-4k-quality-for-2024/"><u>Elite 8 Blu-Ray Player Rankings for 4K Quality for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It is sold in single color scheme of white, red and black which can be termed as its signature colors. With a weight of around 190g, Bandit is not part of small action cameras. It feels like a tank, having a cylindrical body which can be termed as the strongest of all action cameras in the market. The material which surrounds its body is ABS plastic, and its fit and finish is excellent and thus there is no doubt that its build quality is extremely impressive. It has got a LCD screen which is situated at top of Bandit camera and is used only for navigating, changing and viewing menus, settings and other in-camera features with the help of a panel of 4 action buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tomtom-bandit-design.jpg"                      alt="tomtom-bandit-design"                ></p><p> The bottom of the camera has a clever mounting system which allows rotating the camera approximately 180 degrees and rotating mechanism is quite tighter so you can be relieved of its safety.</p><p> Both sides of Bandit are curved, which allows to grip it properly while holding and at the same time the red piece wrapping around it, gives a sporty and stylish outer look.</p><p> The back of the camera includes a module which is completely removable as it contains USB, slot for microSD and a red record button. This means you can simply plug in the whole module in your laptop and charge it when needed. This eliminates the need of carrying and charging cables. Thus, bandit allows wireless charging.</p><p> In combination with its dive lens cover, the camera is fully waterproof. Just a cover can make it waterproof, without making it bulky.</p><h4 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h4><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specification</strong></th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Review Price</strong></td><td>Adventure Pack: £239.99; bike pack: £279.99 (MSRP)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>190g &#x2F; 6.7oz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimension</strong></td><td>94x38x52mm &#x2F; 3.7×1.5×2.0”</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Image sensor</strong></td><td>CMOS with 16Mpixels</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video format</strong></td><td>.mp4,</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video mode</strong></td><td>Time-lapse 1080p 30fps &#x2F; 4k 30fps (Capture every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 seconds)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame rates</strong></td><td>4k 15fps; 2.7k 30fps; 1080p 60&#x2F;30fps; 720p 120&#x2F;60fps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scene mode</strong></td><td>Auto&#x2F;Underwater&#x2F;Night&#x2F;Bright</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Photo modes</strong></td><td>Burst 16 MP &#x2F; 8 MP (Capture 10 continuous frames in 1 or 2 seconds)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audio</strong></td><td>Built-in microphone, external microphone supported</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>MicroSD card for Class 10 (not included)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery</strong></td><td>1900mAh, Up to 3 hours at 1080p 30FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Slow motion</strong></td><td>1080P x 2; 720P x 4; WVGA x 6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sensors</strong></td><td>Built-in GPS and motion sensor for tracking heart rates</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Photo quality</strong></td><td>16MP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB 3.0, APP</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons"></a>Pros and Cons</h4><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Robust and attractive design, catchy to the eyes</td><td>4K only available at 15 frames&#x2F;sec</td></tr><tr><td>LCD display makes configuration easy through vast and varied features</td><td>No professional-grade video data rate options</td></tr><tr><td>Remote control via Smartphone App</td><td>No digital image stabilization and LCD screen doesn’t support watching clips on device</td></tr><tr><td>Quick video editing capacity through the special features of app.</td><td>Needs separate lens cover for waterproofing</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless experience: Charging and data transfer without a cable</td><td>Bulky and thus requires mount to carry it along else it becomes difficult to carry it.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Accessories"><a href="#Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Accessories"></a>Accessories</h4><p> TomTom has launched the Bandit in two following packs:</p><p> A cheaper Adventure Pack which contains Backpack Mount and, A more expensive Bike Pack containing Flexible Handle Bar mount; Vented helmet mount; Remote Control</p><p> Accessories contained in the box:</p><ul><li>TomTom Bandit action camera</li><li>Adapter for GoPro Mounts</li><li>Removable Batt-Stick</li><li>Anti-Rotation Clip</li><li>Microphone Windshield</li><li>Splash-proof Lens cover</li><li>Dive Lens Cover to waterproof the camera</li><li>Basic Surface Mounts (1X1)</li></ul><p> Bandit may not come with quantities of accessories, but some of the them such as surface mounts and dive lens cover are included.</p><p> There are various other accessories which can simply alleviate your shooting experience.

Its great image sensors combined with its resolution quality give an extra boost to the video. What comes out is the image which is sharp, clear, natural, clean and absolutely fantastic. Bandit allows to record 4K 15 FPS and 2.7K @30FPS as well as 1080p@60FPS, which is one of the loveable features. This is because 15FPS works best for the pictures which involves less motion. This means while shooting a lake, mountain, waterfall or anything involving less motion you can use 15 FPS. Its 30 and 60 FPS are a boon for shooting motion pictures and night clips.</p><p> Check out <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/action-camera/best-4k-action-camera.html" >Top 7 Best 4K Action Cameras for 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Now!</p><p> Vibrant and bright image highlighting, all details simply make the most of your memories. The Burst photography mode allows you to take 10 shots in 1 or 2 seconds, making a quick video clip of these quick candid clicks. Its slow motion capturing feature emphasizes your biggest emotions in slow motion.</p><p> Another impressive feature of Bandit is that it creates video of shots taken over a period of time. It is pretty amazing to combine all the different clips to frame into one and then see the continuity. So this means that images taken at a preset interval are compiled into a ready to go movie with time-lapse mode. You can select the frequency of shots that should be taken ranging from 5 to 60 seconds. This simply captures stunning transitions like glowing sunsets and sunrises from the peak, waves at a beautiful beach and much more.</p><p> So this means that when you are snowboarding Mount Fuji, diving with dolphins in an ocean and spending quality time with your family, one thing which you cannot forget is TomTom Bandit.

Battery Life and Charging"></a><strong>2. Battery Life and Charging</strong></h4><p> Fully charged battery of TomTom Bandit can record 1080p 30fps continuously for 3 hours. At 60fps, battery runs only for 2 hours because of usage of higher capacity. The camera has an inbuilt feature to enter into standby mode after 2 minutes if not being used. This is just an effort towards power saving. It will turn itself off after 2 hours of standby mode. When you are using the camera through Bandit mobile App through Wi-Fi connectivity, it can also run for 2 hours on a fully charged battery. Its infrastructure impresses through its common module for USB and the battery which is completely removable. So you can remove it and plug it into your laptop and do the charging and transfering of clips at the same time. Also, investing in other Batt-stick which can be easily swapped for a discharged one is very much advisable.</p><h4 id="3-Waterproof"><a href="#3-Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="3. Waterproof"></a><strong>3. Waterproof</strong></h4><p> The lens cover waterproofs the camera upto 50m during any high impact activity. Conforming to IPX8 standards, this dive lens cap is very easy to remove and re-apply. The lens cover is basically made of hardened glass that repels water and is scratch resistant too at the same time. This lens helps in eliminating any underwater distortion and thus you can swim with dolphins or shoot in the rain or snow without any tension of damage.</p><p> Check out <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/action-camera/best-waterproof-action-camera.html" >Top 7 Best Waterproof Action Camera For 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> now.</p><h4 id="4-Sensor-Capacity"><a href="#4-Sensor-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. Sensor Capacity:"></a><strong>4. Sensor Capacity:</strong></h4><p> A very rare and less seen feature in action cameras is the sensor capacity. Built-in motion sensors are setup in a way to automatically identify a highlight whenever you have made a big move involving high speed, deceleration or pulling a major stunt. It tracks speed, rotation, alleviation, altitude and much more by the pumping of your heart. You can highlight and tag them in the video to relive those moments while watching the video.</p><p> Looking for an action camera with GPS feature?

APP"></a><strong>5. APP</strong></h4><p> Bandit App allows you to edit hours of action video within few minutes. You just don’t need to download the video in your device first; you can simply edit it and directly upload to your social media platforms or save it to your library. Another broader feature of this app is that it allows you to create a story from the best part of your recordings. The Bandit app is very sophisticated as far as features are concerned as it helps in controlling overlays, adjusting the video resolution and clustering continuous clicks. You can tag the metrics of motion sensors manually with the tagging button on camera or through remote control. With an in-built media server it becomes easy to review the footage instantly using its superfast viewfinder. A simple shake of the phone instantly creates an exciting movie by joining short snippets of the clips automatically. This means it is possible to reduce 2.5 hours of raw footage editing to mere 2.5 minutes. You can watch the tutorial below about how to use TomTom Bandit App to get more detailed information.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> TomTom might be new to this action camera field, but Bandit clearly reflects the homework which it has put in technology.

However, the sad part is that the audio signal suffers from distortion when mics are connected through protective cases. Moreover, waterproof cases never even allow access to mic ports directly.</p><p>In such cases, we need to buy additional protective cases or frames that can allow easy connectivity with audio ports. As the latest designs of GoPro do not possess audio jack so in that case you need a microphone adapter to capture sound without distortion.</p><p>Below are few details about some of the <strong>best microphones that can be used with Action Cameras</strong> to achieve improvement over sound quality. The products listed below are not in a particular order.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn how to improve action camera sound <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: 10 Best Microphones for Action Camera</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Different Types of Microphones</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-10-Best-Microphones-for-Action-Camera"><a href="#Part-1-10-Best-Microphones-for-Action-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 10 Best Microphones for Action Camera"></a>Part 1: 10 Best Microphones for Action Camera</h2><h3 id="Shotgun-Microphones-for-GoPro"><a href="#Shotgun-Microphones-for-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Shotgun Microphones for GoPro"></a>Shotgun Microphones for GoPro</h3><h4 id="1-Rode-VideoMic-Pro-Compact-VMP-Shotgun-Microphone"><a href="#1-Rode-VideoMic-Pro-Compact-VMP-Shotgun-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Top-Tips-Choosing-the-Right-FPS-for-Your-Slow-Motion-Vids"><a href="#Top-Tips-Choosing-the-Right-FPS-for-Your-Slow-Motion-Vids" class="headerlink" title="Top Tips: Choosing the Right FPS for Your Slow Motion Vids"></a>Top Tips: Choosing the Right FPS for Your Slow Motion Vids</h2><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography. Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><h2 id="1-60-fps"><a href="#1-60-fps" class="headerlink" title="1. 60 fps"></a>1. 60 fps</h2><p>Anything higher than 30 fps is for creating slow-motion videos. 60 fps is the standard slow motion frame rate for Hollywood movies. You must have come across scenes where the superhero walks out slowly in a dramatic manner. Such scenes are shot at 60fps and displayed at 24 or 30 fps. Besides, this frame rate is suitable for capturing character’s emotions as well.</p><p>Basically, you should use 60 fps when the action is already slow. Some examples are someone walking out of an action sequence, blowing off candles, or getting dressed. Shooting video at 60fps enhances the smoothness of the action. The visuals look more detailed and real. That is why people shoot 4K videos at 60fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for any action that is already slow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="60 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-120-fps"><a href="#2-120-fps" class="headerlink" title="2. 120 fps"></a>2. 120 fps</h2><p>Let us assume that you are shooting at 120 fps and displaying at 30 fps. The video will play 4 times slower than it is in real life. The slow-motion effect will be two times slower than shooting at 60fps. If you shoot slow action at 120 fps, the output will be unusually slow and visually unpleasant. Therefore, you should shoot fast action scenes at 120 fps.</p><p>Some of the examples are someone running, playing slow sports, or drifting a car. You will find professionals using 120 fps for showing the slow-motion football kick and baseball bat swing. The scene will come out super smooth and visually crisp. 120 fps is widely used in the gaming industry for fast-paced action games.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast-paced action and fast moving subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/120-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="120 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="3-180-fps"><a href="#3-180-fps" class="headerlink" title="3. 180 fps"></a>3. 180 fps</h2><p>The scenes that are suitable for 120 fps are also suitable for 180 fps. This means you can shoot fast-moving subjects, objects, and elements. Some of the examples are horse riding, subject running, riding a bike, and likewise. But when you shoot at 180 fps, your objective is to show down the action much further.</p><p>This means that a scene shot at 180 fps will look slower than at 120 fps. You must have seen scenes where an object in motion is slowed down and zoomed in for detail. Such scenes are perfect for 180 frame rate. You may not achieve super slow mow scenes but it is going to be somewhere near that.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast moving action with emphasis on slow downing motion further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/180-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="180 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="4-240-fps"><a href="#4-240-fps" class="headerlink" title="4. 240 fps"></a>4. 240 fps</h2><p>When you are capturing an action that is too fast for your eyes to see, you should use 240 fps. For example, when you are watching a fast-paced sports event, your eyes cannot capture all movements. When you capture those scenes at 240 fps, the output video will look more comfortable for the eyes. The use of 240 fps is very popular in sports like cricket.</p><p>The broadcasters show replays in slow motion by capturing bat and ball strikes at 240 fps. You will also come across videos like slow mow water splashes that are shot at 240 fps. In action movies, you can see the hero punching the villain in the face. Then the scene shows the impact of the punch on the face with skin and muscle getting shattered. Such scenes are perfectly shot at 240 fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for action that are too fast for the eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/240-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="240 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="5-480-fps"><a href="#5-480-fps" class="headerlink" title="5. 480 fps"></a>5. 480 fps</h2><p>If you want super slow motion video, you have to shoot at 480 fps. The 480 frame rate is considered to be the base of super slow motion. There are higher frame rates available for more enhanced super slow-motion videos. When you shoot at 480 fps, the video will play 16 times slower. This is usual in showcasing extremely fast movements.</p><p>For example, when you are shooting with a gun, the bullet goes out at lightning speed. You will need 480 fps to capture the scene of the bullet coming out of the gun and show it in extremely slow motion. Some other scenarios are slicing a vegetable with a knife, dropping a water-filled balloon on the floor, or performing skateboard skills. All such scenarios should be shot at 480 fps for super slow video output.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting extremely fast actions and show in super slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/480-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="480 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no definite answer to which is the best frame rate for slow motion. It completely depends on what you are shooting. Yes, it is true that 60 fps is the standard slow motion fps. But 60 fps is only suitable when the action is low as well. Different frame rates are suitable for different scenes. The faster the action you are shooting, the higher should be the frame rate. For smooth super slow motion video, you should consider shooting at 480 fps. Frame rate beyond 480 is suitable for capturing slow-motion explosion videos.</p><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography. Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-filmmakers-guide-to-distorting-space-and-time/"><u>[New] The Filmmaker's Guide to Distorting Space & Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-vegas-pro-21-a-comprehenive-examination-for-gamblers-and-techies-alike/"><u>[Updated] Vegas Pro '21  A Comprehenive Examination for Gamblers and Techies Alike</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-total-zen-closing-virtual-horizons/"><u>In 2024, Total Zen  Closing Virtual Horizons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-genius-behind-effective-podcast-visual-identity/"><u>2024 Approved  The Genius Behind Effective Podcast Visual Identity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamsurf-skimming-above-dacast/"><u>2024 Approved  StreamSurf  Skimming Above DaCast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-3d-text-design-in-ps/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to 3D Text Design in PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/understanding-optimal-frames-per-second-in-cinema-slow-mo-for-2024/"><u>Understanding Optimal Frames Per Second in Cinema Slow-Mo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-tips-for-pop-culture-meme-success/"><u>In 2024, Top Tips for Pop Culture Meme Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-vision-ai-photography-workshop/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Vision AI Photography Workshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-samsung-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition to Other Android Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-google-pixel-8-pro-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step Tutorial How To Bypass Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/10-shopping-powerhouses-where-to-buy-personalized-present-wrappers/"><u>10 Shopping Powerhouses  Where to Buy Personalized Present Wrappers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-instagram-video-dimensions-for-peak-performance/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Instagram Video Dimensions for Peak Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-add-text-effects-in-adobe-premiere-pro/"><u>Updated In 2024, How to Add Text Effects in Adobe Premiere Pro?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/2024-approved-want-to-play-a-video-in-the-loop-on-your-mac-here-is-how-you-can-make-a-video-loop-in-quicktime-in-simple-steps/"><u>2024 Approved Want to Play a Video in the Loop on Your Mac?

While professional cameras are often heavy and delicate, not to mention expensive, smaller action cameras combine affordability and durability. While that’s a good start, the newest offerings offer full, 360-degree images to capture every part of the experience.</p><p>While 360-degree video isn’t yet in widespread use, VR headsets are becoming more and more affordable. These are made for 360-degree video and photos, where users are allowed to turn and look whichever way interests them most, and explore the whole scene, not just the parts that you first thought were worth capturing.</p><p>Here are 5 great 360-degree action cameras, specially chosen for being compact, affordable, and high quality.</p><h2 id="1-Nikon-Keymission-360"><a href="#1-Nikon-Keymission-360" class="headerlink" title="1. Nikon Keymission 360"></a>1. Nikon Keymission 360</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-action-camera-nikon-keymission.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Nikon Key Mission 360"                ></p><p>This upcoming camera, made by a prominent camera company, is set to be a big player in the 360 action cam market. With an expected retail price of $499, it will be comparable to other cameras in the market. This two lens camera is meant to take everything you can throw at it, being waterproof to 100 feet, as well as dust, shock, and cold resistant. The camera will shoot in 4K UHD, with other details about still photo quality still to be released. While we won’t know for sure how well Samsung delivers on its promises until the camera is released, expectations are high. Expect this new entry to be a strong competitor in the market, and if you don’t need a 360-degree camera just yet, it may well be worth waiting for this one.</p><h2 id="2-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#2-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="2. Giroptic 360cam"></a>2. Giroptic 360cam</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affordable-360-camera-giroptic.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Giroptic"                ></p><p>This pear-shaped camera has three lenses, whose images are combined to form a composite. It isn’t quite as tough as Nikon’s is expected to be, but is waterproof to 30 ft and features an accelerometer and gyroscope to help keep video steady and level while shooting. With a video resolution of 1024x2048 and photo resolution of 2048x4096, this camera is built to take high quality video. At about $500, it is a similar price to the Nikon, and many other contenders in the category. This camera is controlled remotely using an app and allows live streaming. While it’s great for taking an action video, it also works well as a security camera, as it can be set to start recording upon detection of sound or motion.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Giroptic &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-VSN-360"><a href="#3-VSN-360" class="headerlink" title="3.

VSN 360</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-action-camera-vsn.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - VSN 360"                ></p><p>This camera counts in the 360-degree market because horizontally, it takes a full 360-degree image. However, its vertical view is limited to a 60-degree angle. This shortcoming is one of the reasons that many people prefer other cameras for their VR film making. Instead of using multiple lenses, the VSN 360 relies on a single camera and a conical mirror to capture its 360-degree view. Retailing for around $449, this camera is less expensive than some, but more expensive, and tougher, than the 360-cams designed for more mundane uses. Some people criticize its video quality, but then, it was an early entrant in a category that is growing rapidly. Like most others, it uses an app for most camera controls, as well as for its video conferencing capabilities, not the most action packed use, but an interesting one.</p><h2 id="4-Kodak-Pixpro-SP360"><a href="#4-Kodak-Pixpro-SP360" class="headerlink" title="4. Kodak Pixpro SP360"></a>4. Kodak Pixpro SP360</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-action-camera-kodak-pixpro-sp360.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Kodak Pixpro SP"                ></p><p>Offered by the well-known Kodak company, this camera uses a single, dome shaped lens to capture a 360-degree view of the world. At $449, this is slightly less expensive than other cameras. Like the Keymission, this camera is built like a tank, resistant to water, shocks, and dust. However, unlike the Keymission, it is not waterproof, so I wouldn’t take it swimming with you. It shoots stills with 8MP resolution, and 2880x2880 video. For many people, the quality of the images shot by the Kodak camera just doesn’t measure up to other 360-degree cameras. Still, as one of the toughest inexpensive models available, consider it if you tend to be hard on your gear.</p><h2 id="5-BublCam"><a href="#5-BublCam" class="headerlink" title="5. BublCam"></a>5. BublCam</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affordable-360-camera-bublcam.png"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Bublcam"                ></p><p>Retailing for $800, Bublcam is the most expensive camera in this line up, but makes up for it with its high-quality, spherical photos and videos. Bublcam uses 4 lenses to take 14 MP stills and 1080p video, and includes motion activated stabilization features to keep shaky camera work from ruining your videos. The camera is best controlled through the app, available for iOS or Android, but can also be run in a rudimentary fashion using the buttons on the device.

In addition, the <strong>Magic Call app</strong> allows you to customize the background of your calls with sound effects like rain, traffic, music concert, rain, and more. Just select a contact and start your Magic Call. But as good as it comes, many users complain that Magic Call doesn’t work as intended. Is that true? We dive into the app to bring you this first-hand experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working"><a href="#Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?"></a>Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg"                      alt="magic call voice changer app on app store"                ></p><p>So, does <a class="link"   href="http://www.magiccall.co/" >Magic Call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you’ll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.</p><p>Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn’t run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the “Continue” button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn’t send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.</p><p>In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn’t send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects. In addition, Magic Call gives new users 2 minutes of free call time, after which you’ll have to purchase call credits. Overall, it’s a decent app, although better alternatives exist.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call"><a href="#Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call"></a>Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call</h2><p>To avoid the troubles that come with Magic Call, here are some highly rated alternatives to consider:</p><h3 id="1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App"><a href="#1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App" class="headerlink" title="1.
