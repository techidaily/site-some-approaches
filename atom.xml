Check them out below.</p><p><strong>1. Existence for long</strong></p><p>As we mentioned earlier, PewDiePie was created when there were not many YouTubers and thus the channel managed to get the attention and subscribers early.

Exclusive Personality</strong></p><p>As can be seen from the videos, the man behind PewDiePie has a charming and exclusive personality. Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg is funny, crazy, and entertaining which makes him popular not only among the young audience but people of all age groups.</p><p><strong>3. Perfect Niche and interesting topics</strong></p><p>For any channel to be a hit, the content plays a major role and PewDiePie clearly knows what the audience wants. The channel from his early days picks up the relevant topics that have also seen growth over the years. Having a niche in gaming content, there is no competition yet for PewDiePie.</p><p><strong>4. Regular uploading of video</strong></p><p>Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.</p><p>In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.</p><p><strong>Most Famous videos of PewDiePie on YouTube</strong></p><p>PewDiePie has uploaded multiple gaming and other comic content videos that are popular among viewers.

It is also easy to target specific audiences and get your message heard by the right people.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll uncover all of their secrets and learn how to create successful ad campaigns on Spotify.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Audio Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Spotify Video Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Overlay Ads (Display Ads)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Sponsored List</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Successful Examples of Spotify Ads</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-Should-You-Use-Spotify-Ads"><a href="#Why-Should-You-Use-Spotify-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why Should You Use Spotify Ads?"></a>Why Should You Use Spotify Ads?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spotify-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="spotify logo on newspaper"                ></p><p>Spotify currently has over<a class="link"   href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/" >430 million active users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> every single month. A little over 50% of those users don’t have Spotify premium. This means they will be exposed to ads. So, you have a potential audience of over 200 million people.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://headphonesaddict.com/listening-to-music-statistics/" >23% of all recorded users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> use a streaming service like Spotify to listen to music. This is the highest percentage compared to all other methods of listening to music. The most common devices used are a car’s radio and smartphones.</p><p>Additionally, Spotify’s ads system is quite effective. Most of their free-plan users expect to hear ads. Therefore, they are prepared and will listen through the entire ad while focusing on the message.</p><p>These are more than enough reasons to understand the potential of Spotify ads.</p><p>Also, did you know that you can create several ads on Spotify that differ significantly? Yes, there are four significant types of Spotify ads.</p><h2 id="4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One"><a href="#4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One" class="headerlink" title="4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)"></a>4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)</h2><p>We already discussed the incredible potential and exposure ads on Spotify can bring. Now, it’s time to find out what type of ad will be ideal in your case.</p><h3 id="Audio-Ads"><a href="#Audio-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Audio Ads"></a>Audio Ads</h3><p>Any guide to Spotify ads will tell you that their audio ads are the easiest to create. Anyone can make them. You must record a 15-30 second audio clip sharing your message.</p><p>Spotify’s Ad Studio offers fantastic tools to help you create your ads. You may also place a creative image on the ad with a link straight to your landing page, website, or offer.</p><p>The idea is to make this a straightforward process that makes the listener want to click.</p><p>Spotify is accurate at predicting when the user is most receptive. That’s when it will play your audio ad.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Video-Ads"><a href="#Spotify-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Video Ads"></a>Spotify Video Ads</h3><p>Video ads on Spotify are 15 to 30-second clips that include audio and visuals to convey a message.

Some of the concerns that they are sharing are – interaction patterns, reality-trade-off and fidelity contract in terms of physics rule, affordance and narrative expectations.</p><p> It is quite expected that in future, more and more best practices will converge together with even more advanced research in VR psychology and UX.

Though, if a picture has been taken a long time back, then it might lose its quality. A lot of people end up losing their precious photos due to all kinds of incidents.</p><p>Therefore, it is highly recommended to digitize photos to make them lasting. In this way, you can make your photos last forever and keep them handy. In this post, I’m going to discuss some smart ways to <strong>digitize photos</strong> without any hassle. In another case, you may want to know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to restore old photos in old devices. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/digitize-old-photos.jpg"                      alt="Digitize Old Photos"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Convert Old Photos into a Video with Ease?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: More Editing Tips for Creating Memorable Videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="4-Smart-Ways-to-Digitize-Your-Memorable-Old-Photos"><a href="#4-Smart-Ways-to-Digitize-Your-Memorable-Old-Photos" class="headerlink" title="4 Smart Ways to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos"></a>4 Smart Ways to Digitize Your Memorable Old Photos</h2><p>With time, the way we capture moments has also been changed. These days, Polaroid cameras have been replaced by various smartphones and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K DSLR cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Nevertheless, you can digitize your photos in either of the following ways so that you can convert them into softcopy and easily move them around.</p><h4 id="1-Use-your-Smartphones-or-Digital-Cameras"><a href="#1-Use-your-Smartphones-or-Digital-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="1. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras"></a>1. Use your Smartphones or Digital Cameras</h4><p>This is something that you might have thought of doing before as well. We all use smartphones to take pictures, but have you ever thought of using the device’s camera to scan your old photographs. The same can be done by using any digital camera too.</p><p>Just make sure that you have proper lighting and all the pictures are organized. Now, just use your smartphone camera to take their pictures. Later, you can connect your phone (or its SD card) to your computer and transfer these scanned copies to any secure location. If you want, you can also upload your photos to the cloud to keep them safe.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Scanner"><a href="#2-Use-a-Scanner" class="headerlink" title="2. Use a Scanner"></a>2. Use a Scanner</h4><p>If you have access to a scanner, then it would make it pretty easy for you to digitize photos. Most of the digital scanners won’t even cost that much. Therefore, if you have a lot of pictures to scan, then you can just buy a scanner. You can also find a scanner available at a nearby digital store that you can use on a per-copy basis.</p><p>Once you have scanned your photos, you can transfer them to a pen drive or move them to any other device of your choice.</p><h4 id="3-Use-a-Photo-Scanner-App"><a href="#3-Use-a-Photo-Scanner-App" class="headerlink" title="3. Use a Photo Scanner App"></a>3. Use a Photo Scanner App</h4><p>There are also tons of readily available apps that you can use on your Android or iOS devices to digitize photos. You can just go to the App Store or Play Store on your device to browse the available scanner apps (most of them are free).</p><p>Some popular photo scanners that you can consider using are Scanner Pro, PhotoScan, ShoeBox, or PicScanner. Out of them, PhotoScan by Google is one of the most reliable options that I would recommend. It will help you easily scan your photos, edit them accordingly, and minimize their glare. You can also directly load your scanned pictures to your Google Photos account from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photo-scanner-app.jpg"                      alt="Photo Scanner App"                ></p><h4 id="4-Get-in-Touch-with-a-Professional"><a href="#4-Get-in-Touch-with-a-Professional" class="headerlink" title="4.

There are tons of photo digitization services that you can explore in almost every major city to get dedicated assistance.</p><h2 id="How-to-Convert-Old-Photos-into-a-Video-Effortlessly"><a href="#How-to-Convert-Old-Photos-into-a-Video-Effortlessly" class="headerlink" title="How to Convert Old Photos into a Video Effortlessly?"></a>How to Convert Old Photos into a Video Effortlessly?</h2><p>By now, you would be able to digitize photos and have a soft copy of your old photographs. Apart from that, a lot of people would also like to make a video collage of their favorite pictures as well. If you have old pictures of a loved one and a special occasion is coming, then a video collage of their photos would be one of the best gifts.</p><p>To convert your old photos into stunning videos, you can take the assistance of Filmora.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Designer’s-Odyssey-Navigating-to-Professional-Prominence"><a href="#The-Designer’s-Odyssey-Navigating-to-Professional-Prominence" class="headerlink" title="The Designer’s Odyssey: Navigating to Professional Prominence"></a>The Designer’s Odyssey: Navigating to Professional Prominence</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, entering the world of graphic design is easier than you might think. Designers rely on their practical experience to guide them, regardless of their level of schooling. If you have the desire to always learn new things and challenge yourself, you may be a graphic artist at heart. Although it’s a fascinating industry to enter, many aspiring designers can become bogged down in the early stages. This article will examine the profession of graphic design before outlining the ten stages necessary to become one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/graphic-design-career.jpg"                      alt="graphic design career"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Learn-Graphic-Designing"><a href="#Part-1-Learn-Graphic-Designing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Learn Graphic Designing"></a>Part 1. Learn Graphic Designing</h2><p>You must have a thorough understanding of graphic design principles before you can become a graphic designer. A well-made design takes time to create. It takes extensive planning as well as knowledge of how to apply design philosophy and principles. Lines, color, shape, space, texture, typography, scale, dominance and emphasis, and harmony are all factors that graphic designers must consider. Each of these factors has an effect on a design and influences how an audience feels. Here are a few methods to get started:</p><p><strong>Take a graphic design course</strong></p><p>A graphic design course teaches you the principles of design and aids in your skill development by having you work on projects. You’ll meet peers and mentors through graphic design courses, and they’ll be useful as you expand your network. Topics including color theory, typography, layout, and graphic design tools and software will likely be covered in the majority of graphic design courses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/take-graphic-design-course.jpg"                      alt="take graphic design course"                ></p><p>Some courses may also instruct you on the history of graphic design, user experience (UX), and website design principles, depending on their depth. There are several alternatives, ranging from academic courses with rigid structure to more flexible online courses. Find one that fits your learning style and timetable.</p><p><strong>Practice your design skills</strong></p><p>Remember, practice makes perfect. It’s time to put your newfound knowledge of graphic design ideas and tools into practice. Working on your own design projects is the best approach to develop your abilities and become a master of graphic design software. You might start by making imitation advertisements and company logos for real or imagined businesses.</p><p>In order to discover and design for target consumers, you may also use a current company’s designs as inspiration for a new design. Volunteering for regional nonprofits or businesses is another choice. Give these organizations your design expertise to obtain additional practice and practical experience.</p><p><strong>Create a portfolio</strong></p><p>Any graphic designer must have a strong portfolio. Projects you did for a course as well as personal or professional projects can be included in your portfolio. Pay attention to quality over quantity. Since your portfolio will serve as potential employers’ or clients’ initial impression of you, choose pieces that highlight your design expertise and passions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Find-Clients"><a href="#Part-2-Find-Clients" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Find Clients"></a>Part 2. Find Clients</h2><p>It’s crucial to land your first customers as quickly as you can. This will help you launch your company and give you the confidence and drive you need. You might try looking for clients on freelance job websites or use your personal network. Find out if your friends, co-workers, or family members know of anyone looking for a graphic designer. Here are some great places we find valuable to find potential graphic design clients:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-graphic-design-clients-online.jpg"                      alt="find graphic design clients online"                ></p><p><strong>UpWork</strong></p><p>Upwork, which has long been favored by the freelance community, gives its members a location to locate new clients to support small businesses. Upwork should undoubtedly be on your list if you’re looking to connect with new clients because of its innovative matching system, which connects jobs to applicants with the highest-rated work and guarantees a wide range of chances and high pay.</p><p><strong>Behance</strong></p><p>Behance, an Adobe creation, is the top website for designers to display their original work. With social features like the ability to comment on and “like” items, as well as a jobs board, it gives businesses the chance to look for talent on a worldwide scale. The best part is that it functions as an online, visual CV and is totally free.</p><p><strong>OneSite</strong></p><p>OnSite presents itself as a platform for top-notch, hand-picked independent contractors with no middleman and no commission.

But when it comes to graphic design, one key question often comes to mind: Will you be able to support yourself as a graphic designer?</p><p>Yes, you’re interested in the average salary of graphic designers, but you also have a lot of other pressing inquiries that require a response. Before deciding to pursue this creative career, you should have a comprehensive understanding of the position if you want to make an informed decision.</p><p>What does a graphic designer get paid? What abilities are necessary for graphic designers to succeed? How does one become one, too? All of these questions have answers, in addition to others. Discover the information you need to decide if a career in graphic design is a good fit for you by continuing to read.</p><p>When analyzing graphic designer pay data, there are many different things to take into account. Earning potential might vary depending on a number of factors, including education, location, expertise, job situation, and more. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the median annual wage for graphic designers was $53,380 in 2020.</p><p>You can see that these creative professionals make a good livelihood by comparing that to the $41,950 national average for all occupations. The prospective earnings of graphic designers might also be influenced by the industry they work in. The BLS reports that the median annual compensation for graphic designers working in the advertising, public relations, and allied services sector in 2020 was slightly higher ($55,800) than that of graphic designers employed in other common industries like printing and publishing.</p><p>The following countries are great for graphic designers:</p><p><strong>The United Kingdom</strong></p><p>In the UK, business is booming in the design sector. In actuality, the design and designer fashion sectors’ gross value added (GVA) reached £2.52 billion, or $3.35 billion, in 2018. With many top-tier agencies based in London and Glasgow, the UK is one of the world’s major design hubs.</p><p>The UK is one of the most alluring nations for American designers for a number of reasons. There are no linguistic obstacles, on the one hand. However, the cost of living in the UK is 12.21% lower than it is in the US. It implies that housing costs are lower there. However, one of the nations with the highest incomes for graphic design is the United Kingdom. The best paid cities are the bigger ones like London, where the average yearly wage is $72,500.</p><p><strong>Canada</strong></p><p>Despite having a relatively tiny population for such a vast country in terms of area, Canada does have a vibrant design culture. The national average compensation for graphic designers is $48,750 per year. As in other countries, the necessity to streamline brand assets across numerous media has increased demand for designers, especially those with expertise in multiple design disciplines.</p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>According to an interesting fact, China had the highest percentage of smartphone users in the world in 2020. It surpasses Indonesia, the United States, and India with a penetration rate of 60.75 percent. China has a sizable and loyal mobile user base. Mobile design and development are thus one of the top objectives in the nation.</p><p>Particularly Shenzhen is a recognized design capital and one of the top cities for innovation and the creative industries. It has financing to support local startups and is recognized as a City of Design. Using the Creative Cities Network.</p><p>In Shenzhen, 6,000 design firms employ almost 100,000 workers. Graphic designers in China get an average salary of $1276 per year, according to Payscale. Chinese graphic design salaries are lower than those in the US.</p><p>The Red Dragon, on the other hand, has a lower cost of living than America—in fact, it is 34.1 percent less expensive. You would make a good living and have a big wage if you moved to the country.</p><p><strong>Israel</strong></p><p>Israel’s entrepreneurial community is flourishing.

Choose the Software"></a>Part 4. Choose the Software</h2><p>The best graphic design software for you might depend on your needs, but if you work with a variety of clients and require a wide range of features, you might want to stick with one of the most well-known programs. Based on our own assessments, we’ve selected the best graphic design software currently on the market. This list includes everything from general-purpose software packages to specialized solutions for specialized markets. We have created a list for you to check out when looking for graphic designer software.</p><p><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></p><p>There isn’t much reason to seek further if you want the greatest graphic design program for vector drawing and editing. Adobe Illustrator. For a good reason—we think it still provides the most robust selection of tools and functionality for vector editing—it is still the industry standard software.</p><p>Illustrator lets you to design everything from graphics to logos with complete creative freedom while having a ton of tools and shortcuts to help speed up your workflow. It is compatible with PC, Mac, and even iPads. We were happy with several of the improvements Adobe made to maintain their throne, including the ability to customize the toolbar, Rotate View, and a Width Tool that makes it simple to add variations to vector lines.</p><p><strong>Affinity Designer</strong></p><p>Serif’s Affinity Designer is a very capable substitute if you think Adobe’s membership pricing structure is a touch too much. Affinity Designer is the best graphic design software you can buy for a one-time fee, and as it continues to add capabilities, it is almost on par with Illustrator in popularity. In fact, it provides various tools not found in Illustrator, such as unlimited redo’s and a zoom of more than one million percent.</p><p>If coworkers or clients use Adobe products, you don’t have to worry about compatibility because Affinity Designer supports both Illustrator AI and Photoshop PSD files. Affinity Designer probably runs quicker than Adobe Illustrator as well.</p><p><strong>CorelDRAW</strong></p><p>Although Adobe Illustrator gained some of CorelDRAW’s early popularity, it still has a devoted following, and the software’s 2021 update brought about several significant improvements. A Mac version (opens in new tab), which was previously only available for Windows, became available in 2019, helping to increase the package’s appeal by adding many of Illustrator’s features at a somewhat lower cost. Since you have the option of making a one-time payment or a subscription, you also have additional financial flexibility.</p><p>In spite of this, importing and exporting AI and PDF files to CorelDRAW is trouble-free. However, you should select one over the other mostly because you like the interface and process better. We advise joining up for the free trials of both if you haven’t used either before or have the opportunity to compare them.</p><p><strong>Gravit Designer</strong></p><p>The best free vector-specific graphic design program comes from the makers of Corel Draw and is called Gravit Designer. It can handle the majority of design tasks, from icon design and prototyping to vector drawing and animation, thanks to its clear and user-friendly interface. With the free version, you can access your work from anywhere using the Gravit Cloud and export files as PDF, SVG, or bitmaps.</p><p>You can download a copy of Gravit Designer or use it online. When you sign up, Gravit Designer Pro automatically starts as a free trial; after that, you automatically switch to the free edition, losing the pro capabilities unless you pay for a subscription.</p><p><strong>SVG-Edit</strong></p><p>Using a common vector toolkit, SVG-Edit enables you to edit and generate SVG files. No download is necessary because the software operates directly in your web browser. It isn’t the most complete vector software, but that isn’t really necessary. It will work just fine for vectors that are straightforward or even a little more intricate.</p><p><strong>VectorStyler</strong></p><p>The best vector software includes VectorStyler, a very recent addition. It was initially exclusively accessible for Mac, but it is now also available for Windows. A large selection of scalable vector brushes and the addition of some capabilities that are absent from other Adobe Illustrator competitors, like a form builder, a blend tool, and a pattern tool, are some of its main selling points. It can open and import Illustrator files, and you can import AI brush collections, make vector brushes out of artwork, and dynamically link brush content to editable artwork. You can even generate vector brushes from scratch.</p><p><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></p><p>Most likely, you already know that Adobe Photoshop is the industry-standard program for manipulating images. The program has long been well-known, and just as Illustrator continues to be the greatest vector design software due to its frequent improvements, Photoshop continues to rule in picture manipulation.</p><p>In actuality, it is capable of far more than just image manipulation, including photo retouching, digital painting and drawing, 3D modeling, and user experience design. It is a fully functional program, and Adobe has been expanding its arsenal of AI capabilities under the Adobe Sensei brand so that you can quickly and easily remove backdrops, for example.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Working-in-Teams"><a href="#Part-5-Working-in-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Working in Teams"></a>Part 5. Working in Teams</h2><p>The effort of several specialists with expertise in disciplines like graphic design, animation, and coding is frequently required for today’s designs. Whether you’re working on a project with two individuals or twenty, improving your team design strategy will streamline your operations and produce better results. Although the skills and personality of your team members may affect how projects are designed, you can usually rely on the following procedures to increase the effectiveness of your work.</p><p>During the team design project, don’t presume that everyone will play a particular position. Knowing everyone’s strengths can help you assign work to them as you progress through the design phases rather than making them sit idle.</p><p>Your illustrator may have prior animation experience. Your illustrator may even have expertise with development in the workplace of today. Even though they lack the necessary expertise to create a website or app, they could be able to advance the project’s initial phase with their rudimentary understanding. The team’s workflow will be accelerated, and your job satisfaction as an illustrator will increase.</p><p>Some people may feel isolated as a result of team design. They might eventually begin to procrastinate on their work, arrive at meetings a little late, or forget to check their messages. Negative feedback would be used in a conventional project management strategy to hold team members accountable.</p><p>You might have to huddle up with some individuals as the project manager to criticize their mistakes. But really, that ought to be your final resort. Utilize positive reinforcement prior to using negative reinforcement to keep team members motivated and appreciated.</p><p>You might not always have the opportunity to assemble your team in one location as more businesses migrate staff and independent contractors to remote employment. The warmth of in-person collaboration will be missed by some. However, working remotely is growing common. Even once the coronavirus pandemic is over, almost 70% of business owners anticipate letting at least some of their staff work remotely.</p><p>On any design job, effective communication is essential. However, if you can’t solve the fundamental issues with remote working, no amount of communication will be of any use. Some of us are entering a completely new world. It’s still beneficial to learn more about how you may succeed in a remote work setting with a team of graphic designers in particular, even if you’ve been working remotely for some time.</p><p>Leading a team at work involves more than just ensuring that everyone provides for your needs. The best managers pay close attention to the long-term requirements of those under their control. Give your team members the resources and opportunities they require to achieve their own professional goals if you want to get the most out of them. Assist them in finding a path that has upward momentum.</p><p>Understanding the individuals you deal with and allocating tasks based on that understanding are both important aspects of managing your graphic design team effectively. Try to assign assignments as much as you can based on who would be the best fit for the job. While some tasks must be completed regardless of whether they are fun or not, doing too much tedious work makes people lose interest in their employment.</p><p>A crucial component of creative activity is engaging others in their work. In general, employees who are more invested in their work will perform better over time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The world of graphic design depends on relationships with other people to advance. Therefore, being really nice and engaged will undoubtedly advance your career. Simply put, communication and relationship-building are essential to our line of work, so you can’t avoid them. One last bit of advice is to keep going. Continue phoning, sending emails, or doing whatever else you do regularly. Reject jealousy and don’t take rejection personally. A rejection today can lead to a job tomorrow or a future new client.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular

Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.</p><p>Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?"></a>Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</h2><p>Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.</p><h3 id="1-Ready-Player-One-3"><a href="#1-Ready-Player-One-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

They will be represented as an avatar. But a few of these might be virtual agents, bots, and artificial intelligence manifestations. If you want, you can hang out with many people in this virtual world. As a matter of fact, you will also be able to do many things together. This social aspect might be the focus of Facebook’s Metaverse that is presented in its history as a social network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/prepare-join-metaverse.jpg"                      alt="prepare join metaverse"                ></p><p>Metaverse advocates and a few researchers think that communication is going to be more natural with the help of video conferencing as you will be able to use gaze to show the person you are addressing. In fact, your avatar might also walk over to sit next to another avatar.</p><h3 id="5-Persistence-3"><a href="#5-Persistence-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Persistence"></a>5. Persistence</h3><p>You have to keep in mind that the digital world of the Metaverse is going to be available whenever you want to pay a visit. It is possible to change it by adding new things, such as virtual buildings or other objects. The changes are going to stay there until you visit the next time. You might be able to get a residence and also own a bit. The Metaverse is going to depend on user-generated content, such as your personal stories or digital creation just as social media does.</p><p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>Metaverse is still under development but several companies have already started exploring it. In the world of cryptocurrency, The Sandbox and Decentraland are noteworthy projects. However, bigger companies, such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Facebook are also getting involved. With the development of AR, VR, and AI, it is most likely that you will come across some exciting features in digital and borderless work. So, the Metaverse is surely something that everybody is looking forward to.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision.

Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results.

This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

That’s why many filmmakers, editors, and colorists working on film use Look Up Tables, or LUTs, to store color grades as templates to help speed up the process.</p><p>We’re letting you know that you don’t have to work on the film to use LUTs to help personalize and mark your videos. If you’re wondering how you can get started with color grading to speed up your workflow and create better-looking shots for your business, we’ve got you covered.</p><p><strong>LUTs in Movies</strong></p><p>Various LUT types are employed during post-production for color grading and color correction.</p><p>First, the two LUT formats work differently. <strong>A 1D LUT</strong> (usually. lut format) controls a single parameter, generally gamma. A 1D LUT takes a sort of blanket approach; the adjustment applies to everything in the image without much flexibility. One parameter affects all colors, saturations, and contrast. <strong>A 3D LUT</strong> (usually a. cube format) has three axes that independently adjust Hue, Saturation, Luminance, Gamma, and Contrast and can change as conditions in the image change. As such, a 3D LUT is much more flexible and powerful and is the only way to achieve a truly cinematic color grade with LUT.</p><p>The other two types of LUTs can be either 1D or 3D LUTs, but these days they are most often 3D LUTs. The difference between them is when in the process you use them and for what purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-3.jpg"                      alt="luts in movies"                ></p><p>An input or camera LUT used at the beginning of the color correction process adjusts the footage so that the color correction tools work correctly. Color corrected recordings that require an input or camera LUT without one can lead to unexpected and unsatisfactory results.</p><p>Conversely, you typically apply a LUT look after you’ve done color correction and moved on to the color grading phase. Use it to dial in the exact artistic look you want. The Look LUT contains instructions to create a predetermined desired look for your shots, which can be an incredible time saver in the color grading process.</p><p>Always colorize an appearance LUT correctly before applying it, as appearance LUTs assume an underlying natural color. If you don’t, you may not see the results that the LUT is supposed to give you.</p><p>LUTs are specially designed for different recording types – LOG, RAW, Rec.709, Rec.2020, HDR, and more. You can apply any LUT to any footage, but if you apply a LUT designed for a specific type of footage to another type, you can end up with a very different look than what you expected. But then it can also give you a result you like, so you are free to experiment as you wish. LUTs are non-destructive, so you can load and delete them at will.</p><p>Many camera manufacturers, software companies, and independent producers offer downloadable LUTs or LUT packs. They often design these skins for specific purposes, such as color correcting footage captured by their cameras or to mimic signature skins seen in movies and TV shows. These skins can give you exactly the color class you want, or you can use them and keep tweaking and tweaking to get the perfect look.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources"><a href="#Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> You can tell Microsoft put a considerable amount of thought into the Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard’s design. From the manta ray style folds, which keep shoulders and hands at a relaxed, comfortable angle, to the detached numpad and magnetized risers for increased customization options when you want them, the Sculpt is quite the package. As with anything new, it took a period of adjustment, but we found it relatively quick thanks to the intuitive, easy-to-use design.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Made-for-comfort"><a href="#Design-Made-for-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Design: Made for comfort"></a><strong>Design: Made for comfort</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt is an ergonomic keyboard with a split design akin to that of a manta ray. The two halves of the keyboard sweep outwards and downwards creating an empty, raised space in the center of its swoop design. Its keys vary in size, with those nearest to the split being slightly wider than those on the outer edges of the keyboard. It’s largely made with plastic and has a bit of a clacky sound as you type. The Sculpt employs a standard layout with a fabric wrist pad at the front for extra comfort. This intuitive, split design combined with the wrist pad help your wrists, hands, and shoulders sit at a neutral, natural angle in order to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >alleviate repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that frequent typists are prone to over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Cgdvz2K5QV0PheSGAjQNXTdhKP4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_02-e457e23b0c0848dbaad1197549efcc47.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> One unique feature of the Sculpt we loved was the function switch. Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key. Options include refreshing the active page, navigating to the home page in web, opening up the computer’s settings, a play&#x2F;pause button, switching between active windows, and increasing or decreasing volume.</p><p> Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key.</p><p> Often, keyboards include a next track or previous track multimedia feature, which the Sculpt was decidedly lacking. This was a disappointment, but otherwise, the functions are good inclusions and easy to use. If this extra functionality isn’t your thing, you simply flip this switch to the gray position and these F1-F12 keys retain their standard functionality.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Batteries-required"><a href="#Setup-Process-Batteries-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Batteries required"></a><strong>Setup Process: Batteries required</strong></h2><p> The Microsoft Sculpt arrives in a box with the Sculpt itself, a detached numpad, a setup guide, a registration number, and a product guide. Microsoft provides a magnetic riser that can attach to the bottom of the wrist pad as an additional setup option. It also includes a warning packet on lithium batteries since the detached numpad is powered by a 3V lithium CR2430 battery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MTaN1qUX3urJwcwQ_tv5g532Af4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_03-ec82ba429b58431eabefb1f147f474b9.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> Setting the Microsoft Sculpt up is simple. Simply lift the lid off of the battery compartment on the backside of the unit and remove the slip of paper that separates the two AAA batteries. Then, take the provided dongle from the compartment and attach it to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your PC. If you’re planning on using the detached numpad, don’t forget to also remove the slip of paper from its backside to active it. Then the Sculpt is ready for use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all" class="headerlink" title="Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all"></a><strong>Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all</strong></h2><p> Backlighting—we love it, but the Sculpt doesn’t have it. This is, in large part, thanks to its battery-powered design. It wouldn’t make a great deal of sense for the Sculpt to have backlighting since the two AAA<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-aa-and-aaa-rechargeable-batteries-4134295" >alkaline batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would drain significantly faster, but we sure did miss it. It’s important to note that our love of backlighting is also a matter of personal preference. If it’s important to you, you might want to consider a different model. If you can live without it, the Sculpt still has a lot to offer.</p><p> Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design make this keyboard a surefire winner.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind. This is thanks to the AES 128-bit encryption technology the Sculpt uses to keep your keystrokes safe. Associated to the keyboard at the factory, there simply is no replacing it if it’s lost. While the Sculpt isn’t really travel-friendly due to its size, it would do best in an environment where it’s set up once and stays put so as to prevent losing this important piece of tech.</p><h2 id="Price-Great-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Great-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for the features"></a><strong>Price: Great for the features</strong></h2><p> Ergonomic keyboards tend to cost anywhere from $50-$200. Generally retailing for around $90 on Amazon or $129.95 MSRP, the Sculpt sits in the middle. Its features are nice for the price, too. Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design with a wrist pad for extra comfort makes this keyboard surefire winner in our books.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BarmRhIEQlGkF0UEDLP9peOh3co=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_05-646724c396184c12836f3f2ce2ced675.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599952&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>Epubor Ultimate for Mac:Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt’s main competition is the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard. It’s a split-style ergonomic keyboard that connects wirelessly to a PC. Instead of using plastic materials, the Surface has a higher quality build that is not only more comfortable but slightly more sound-absorbent as well. And, better yet, the Surface uses the fan-favorite Alcantara fabric, an Italian material with a suede-like feel to it, as part of its wrist pad which makes it incredibly comfortable. Its numpad is attached, however, and it doesn’t include a magnetic riser. If you prefer your wrist sitting at a raised, more neutral angle, or if you like the idea of a detached numpad, the Sculpt is the clear winner here.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind.</p><p> Another major difference between them is the Surface doesn’t have a unique dongle associated with it at the factory. So long as your PC has a Bluetooth dongle or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412" >Bluetooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technology built-in, the Surface can connect easily and quickly, but that also means that the Surface’s keystrokes aren’t encrypted.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780282" >Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vn9L7kezNDVwJaDwHzeLbefGfDA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_04-df81d8c1ef3c4387ab900dfa381e1e0f.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Surface is a high-end keyboard, but that quality comes at a higher price.

Prefer to get the latest version, it is easily available over internet and can be downloaded and installed by beginners too. Once your software tool is ready on your system then proceed ahead.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all you need to save your video and subtitle file with same name. It is not possible to manually add subtitles using Window Media Player but it can easily detect all subtitles when both files are saved with same name.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-wmp-1.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are done with the first step then simply open your Window Media Player and move to the Library Mode. Now switch to play, then Lyrics, captions and finally you will reach at subtitles. Hit this option and choose “On if Available”. The same option is also available in the Now Playing Mode where you simply need to right click and this option will appear in drop down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-wmp-2.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, it is time to download DirectVobSub codec and get it installed on your PC. This software is easily available in 32, 64 bit versions so you can easily access any of these. Simply install codec from this source; no need to work on configuration settings. Note that these codecs must be installed from a trusted source so that malware or virus attacks can be avoided.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you are done with step 3 then download Sharkoo7’s Advanced Codec from internet. Get it installed for Window Media Player and then open with 64 bit settings or 32 bit as per your device specifications. To open it, simply right click on icon and from drop down menu choose “Run as administrator”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-wmp-3.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Within very less time application will get opened with a fresh window on your system. Now move to tabs of different video file types then search for the option that says: “Disable Media Foundation for MP4&#x2F;MKV and AVI etc”.
