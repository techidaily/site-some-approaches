It is a sequence of photos stitched together to create a movie or video where time seems to pass extremely fast. For instance, wilting and blooming for the flow only in a 10-second video. You might have seen numerous <strong>Canon time-lapse</strong>s and always wanted to create one.</p><p>If you want to take the challenge and create something magical like this with your Canon camera, you have come to the right place. Here we will tell you everything from how to shoot to editing time-lapse videos. You will also get some tips for time-lapse recording video so let’s start with this article.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?"></a>Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?</h2><p>Time-lapse video is considered a technique of cinematography where a photographer takes a series of images in the same frame at several intervals for a certain period and rapidly plays it for the entire time. For instance:- Separate shots of a flower blooming over time becomes a video of growing a flower from seedling to bloom.</p><p>So what’s the purpose of it? Here is the purpose of creating an illusion of extreme speed movement by manipulating the time. It seems like the object is rushing at a fast pace. This cinematography technique is mainly used for capturing prolonged processes that will become exciting and visible if it is watched with the human eye.</p><p>The time-lapse is even used to capture swift movement, showing it faster. This article will explore how time-lapse on canon 6d is made. In simple words, time-lapse is a process of shooting for an extended period and then editing in fast motion to make it enjoyable. Let’s see how it is done.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?"></a>Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?</h2><p>Let’s explore the time-lapse world in the comfort of your home or when you are chilling out with your family and friends. You can use your Canon 70d time-lapse to do it better. The time-lapse is an innovative technique that allows you to reveal a hidden world on the move, and it will produce some magical and surprising results. Let’s check out the steps of hooting time-lapse video with a Canon camera.</p><p><strong>1:-</strong> Change your Canon camera settings to the Time-lapse movie by tapping on the menu and searching Timelapse Movie mode in your menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-time-lapse-canon-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable time lapse on canon"                ></p><p><strong>2:-</strong> Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.</p><p><strong>3:-</strong> You can choose the interval number to determine your camera’s frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject. Recording a slow-moving object like blossoming flowers or drifting clouds will take more time between the shots and vice versa.</p><p><strong>4:-</strong> Put the number of shots you want your camera to take. According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips"></a>Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips</h2><p><strong>Never forget to take test shots:-</strong> You must never start shooting straight away. Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it’s better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.</p><p><strong>Carry Extra Memory cards:-</strong> You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Choose the best spot:-</strong> Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.</p><p><strong>Focus on the camera:-</strong> Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Importance-of-Non-Primary-Shots-in-Media"><a href="#The-Importance-of-Non-Primary-Shots-in-Media" class="headerlink" title="The Importance of Non-Primary Shots in Media"></a>The Importance of Non-Primary Shots in Media</h2><p>B roll is a phrase used to describe supplemental video, which is frequently used as cutaway video to add visuals and context to your tale. The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1. B roll In TV And Movies"></a>1. B roll In TV And Movies</h2><p>Broll is an acronym for “background” or “behind,” respectively. It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Intolerance.” Griffith’s creative application All of the shots that are used in a movie or television show are collectively referred to as “b roll footage.” To add context and complexity to the production being recorded, these shots are frequently seen on screen in quick succession.</p><p>B roll can be utilized for establishing shots as well as close-ups of items. It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods to use b roll"></a>2. Methods to use b roll</h2><p>Now that there are so many stock footage platforms, you have a lot of choices when you need just the right scene for your project. Most of the time, filmmakers don’t use B roll footage. One good way to use it is to use it as a way to move from one scene to the next. It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3. What types of b roll are there?"></a>3. What types of b roll are there?</h2><p>We’ll examine the top 5 uses for B rolls across a variety of video genres and discuss how to implement them effectively in your own projects.</p><h3 id="1-Archival-b-roll-footage"><a href="#1-Archival-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Archival b roll footage"></a>1. Archival b roll footage</h3><p>Aerial B roll is the solution when you like to show your viewers where your film is being recorded or when you are changing locations and want them to know it. The plane takes off and lands in another city, and then shots of the city, its landmarks, its famous streets, etc. are shown. You have probably seen this type of B roll footage in movies and TV shows. These images aid in putting the viewer in the character’s current location. Check out this collection of setting images from the Neighbors television series.</p><h3 id="2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage"><a href="#2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Visual detail b roll footage"></a>2. Visual detail b roll footage</h3><p>Including archival material in your video allows your audience to experience a previously covered or historically significant story as it occurred. Look at this illustration from Netflix’s 14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible, which was made utilizing old b roll film from the era to help the viewer connect with the narrative.</p><h3 id="3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage"><a href="#3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="3. Storytelling b roll footage"></a>3. Storytelling b roll footage</h3><p>B roll footage can be used to tell a story that supports the narrative of your video. For example, in this video interview of Tom DeLonge, the speaker talks about living in a neighborhood. The B rolls show him driving around in his car, skateboarding on the street in the 90’s. These add to the story the video creator wants to talk about not seeing people with a disability differently.</p><h3 id="4-Undirected-b-roll-footage"><a href="#4-Undirected-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Undirected b roll footage"></a>4. Undirected b roll footage</h3><p>This particular kind of B roll film is captured without any direction being given to your character, as the name suggests. For the purposes of an interview video, for instance, these can be straightforward close-up views of your character’s hands and facial expressions. On the other hand, while you’re doing a documentary, you might record your subject participating in everyday activities.</p><h3 id="5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage"><a href="#5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="5. Atmospheric b roll footage"></a>5. Atmospheric b roll footage</h3><p>When you are sharing a narrative that has been told in the past or that has historical significance, incorporating archival material into your video gives your audience the opportunity to see the story as it occurred at the time. This is especially useful when you are discussing a narrative that has been experienced in the past or that has futuristic relevance.</p><p>Have a look at the scenes from the episode “14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible” that can be found on Netflix. As a result of the use of archive film footage of b roll from the relevant time period in its production, the audience is able to connect with the narrative on a deeper level.</p><h3 id="6-Pick-up-shots"><a href="#6-Pick-up-shots" class="headerlink" title="6. Pick-up shots"></a>6. Pick-up shots</h3><p>A pick-up is a tiny shot added to previously captured material. Re-shoots involve redoing entire scenes. Both types of shots are commonly added during film editing to fix, logic, continuity, or quality flaws. These photos happen a while after the sets have been taken down, clothes and props stowed, and the actors and crew have gone on to new projects.</p><p>If flaws were discovered during primary photography, the directors could have requested another take. The producer and director should weigh the cost of rejoining cast and crew against the need for pick-ups or re-shoots to address storyline flaws (or worse) in the final edit.</p><h3 id="7-A-roll-vs-b-roll"><a href="#7-A-roll-vs-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="7. A roll vs b roll"></a>7. A roll vs b roll</h3><p>Imagine the A roll as part of the video’s story. This could be a documentary film, news show, or scripted sketch. Everything else on your editing table must be rearranged to fit it. When the speaker in the following video is directly talking to the camera or interviewer, this is A roll footage. The video’s most crucial segments were filmed with primary footage.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that this post will be of use to you in making your films more cinematic. You not only know how to film and edit your videos utilizing B rolls, you also have an extremely effective hack that allows you to generate amazing videos using stock footage. This is both impressive and unique.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square

This article will show you how to take amazing reflective photographs with just your iPhone. Apple has really invested in improving the quality of it’s in-built lenses in their latest models of the iPhone. Much of the advertising now concerns the stunning photos it’s users can take. Historically this was reserved to those who had powerful SLR cameras. Of course they also want to compete with other manufacturers to be the phone that takes the best selfie!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-photography-for-iphone.jpg"                      alt="reflection-photography-for-iphone"                ></p><p> Reflective photography is an ever growing trend on social media, so you want your images to stand out… This handy guide tells you everything you need to know, and even how to create reflective photos in post production!</p><p> So let’s get snapping!</p><h2 id="Tips-For-Perfect-Reflective-Photography-With-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Tips-For-Perfect-Reflective-Photography-With-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Perfect Reflective Photography With Your iPhone"></a>Tips For Perfect Reflective Photography With Your iPhone</h2><h4 id="1-The-Surface"><a href="#1-The-Surface" class="headerlink" title="1.  The Surface"></a>1.  The Surface</h4><p> Of course the number one rule of reflective photography is that you have a reflective surface! It doesn’t have to be as simple as a mirror though, as the picture above shows lakes and pools are great if it is a clam weather day. You want to make sure that your surface is clean as far as possible to avoid distraction. If you wanted to be really creative you could find something like these:</p><p> A Well Polished Table</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-surface.jpg"                      alt="reflection-surface"                ></p><p> A Crystal&#x2F;Glass Ball</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crystal-ball.jpg"                      alt="reflection-photography-for-iPhone"                ></p><p> Water in a wine glass (turns everything upside down too!)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/water-reflection.jpg"                      alt="water-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition"><a href="#2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition" class="headerlink" title="2.  Pay Attention to Composition"></a>2.  Pay Attention to Composition</h4><p> Composition is the very basis of good photography, as the person taking the picture you decide the scene. The most integral part of good composition is the rule of thirds. This means you should divide up the scene&#x2F;subject into 9 equal squares&#x2F;rectangles (depending on frame).</p><p> You should put the subject or the most important parts of the scene into one or of the lines. Typically we have an impulse to put the subject straight in the middle of the shot, however placing the subject in othe of the other lines off to the side produces a far more engaging photo.</p><p> It is also really effective to have the subject where the gridlines intersect. This makes the image standout from others in social media feeds. It subconsciously pulls our attention.</p><p> iPhone already has a feature for you to bring up lines before you take the photo with the rule of thirds:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-composition-tips.jpg"                      alt="reflection-composition-tips"                ></p><p> To activate the lines simply go to <strong>Settings &gt; Camera and Photographs &gt; Grid</strong></p><h4 id="3-Keep-it-Simple"><a href="#3-Keep-it-Simple" class="headerlink" title="3.  Keep it Simple"></a>3.  Keep it Simple</h4><p> Reflective photography works best when the scene isn’t busy and there is nothing too distracting. Having one focus&#x2F;subject will produce a clean image and the reflection of the subject will be far more effective.</p><p> Reflective photography should convey a sense of calm, simplicity and tranquility. If the photograph has more than one pull of focus you’re likely to lose this.</p><p> Good</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keep-the-image-simple.jpg"                      alt="keep-the-image-simple"                ></p><p> Awful</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/awful-composition.jpg"                      alt="awful-composition"                ></p><h4 id="4-Reality-and-Reflection"><a href="#4-Reality-and-Reflection" class="headerlink" title="4.  Reality and Reflection"></a>4.  Reality and Reflection</h4><p> Don’t just focus on the reflection, these tend to distract from how good the reflection is. Of course if the reflective surface reflects too well and you just focus on that. The image might come out as looking the same as if you had just pointed and shot the subject.</p><p> You should have a mix of the physical real life subject and the reflection. This way you can demonstrate how effective reflective photography is. The iPhone is well equipped for this with the ability to take high quality photos of even moving subjects in bursts.</p><p> All you need to do is hold down the shutter&#x2F;take photo button and burst mode automatically takes lots of photos until you release.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reality-and-reflection.jpg"                      alt="reality-and-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="5-Texture"><a href="#5-Texture" class="headerlink" title="5.  Texture"></a>5.  Texture</h4><p> Using a still reflective surface is good, but reflective photos are more effective if you have been able to capture texture. Where the reflective surface distorts the real life subject, you’re able to artistically capture an entirely unique affect each time. This is why waves are a great way to create a truly different image with each shot.</p><p> It is also just good photography practice to have your subjects bend and distort the light. The contrasts make for an aesthetically beautiful image, and makes post production optimization even easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-use-of-texture.jpg"                      alt="make-use-of-texture"                ></p><h3 id="Post-Production-Reflective-Effects"><a href="#Post-Production-Reflective-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Post Production Reflective Effects"></a>Post Production Reflective Effects</h3><p> It’s possible to create great reflective photographs by using reflective effects after you have taken it. You can deceptively take one of your great photos and use the reflective effect to make it appear on a reflective looking surface. Here’s some examples of photos that were created using this effect through software:</p><p> The image of the lamp and the puddle were taken separately and meshed together using an app…</p><p> You can do this on iPhone using these apps:</p><table><thead><tr><th>App</th><th>Requirements</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reflect Mirror Camera</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflect-mirror-camera/id898143628?mt=8" >$2.99 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Reflection</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflection-create-water-reflection-photo-arts/id672111257?mt=8" >$2.99 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Photo Reflection</td><td>iOS 9.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-reflection/id484604482?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Photo Mirror Effects</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-mirror-effects-reflection-editor/id1019418266?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-Reflect-Mirror-Camera"><a href="#1-Reflect-Mirror-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1.

And one of the best ways to do that is through video.</p><p>There are many different types of videos you can create, but not all of them will be equally effective at hooking your viewers. To help you get started, here are six types of videos that are sure to capture your audience’s attention on social media:</p><h2 id="1-Behind-the-scenes-videos"><a href="#1-Behind-the-scenes-videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Behind-the-scenes videos"></a>1. Behind-the-scenes videos</h2><p>Your viewers will love getting a peek behind the scenes of your business or organization. Behind-the-scenes videos can give them a look at what goes into making your product or service, and they’ll be able to see the people who make it all happen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/behine-the-scenes-video.jpg"                      alt="behind the scenes video"                ></p><p><strong>Key elements of an effective behind-the-scenes video:</strong></p><ul><li>Make it about the team working together. A behind-the-scenes video is not just about the people working in front of the camera; it’s also about how everyone works as a team. Showcase different departments, use satellite shots to show where you work and include interviews with other members throughout the process. This can help build customer loyalty and improve brand awareness.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to show some personality! Behind-the-scene videos can be funny, but they should never be tacky or inappropriate — even if it means turning down an opportunity for a quick joke or two. Don’t forget: customer service is important too!</li><li>Be honest about how long your process takes during production! When you’re making a video for yourself, it’s easy to think that everyone else will get everything done before you sit down with your camera — but that isn’t always true! If there are any delays or problems with the shoot</li></ul><h3 id="Example-Squid-Game-Behind-the-Scene-Netflix"><a href="#Example-Squid-Game-Behind-the-Scene-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="Example: Squid Game | Behind the Scene | Netflix"></a>Example: Squid Game | Behind the Scene | Netflix</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm7KcmJcc88" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm7KcmJcc88 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-videos"><a href="#2-How-to-videos" class="headerlink" title="2.

This will help viewers understand the value of your work, why it’s important to them, and how it can help them achieve their goals.</li><li>Tell a story - To make your video more impactful, tell a story about how your product or service has impacted someone’s life or made a positive change in their business. Make sure to include personal anecdotes from other people who have used your product or service to illustrate this point, if possible.</li><li>Show the results - People love seeing results! Showing real-life examples of how others have benefited from using your products is the best way to prove that they’re worth investing in. If possible, include photos or videos from before and after projects so viewers can see exactly how much they’ve changed since using your product or service — that way they won’t just be reading about it.</li></ul><h3 id="Example-Click-Funnels-What-Is-It-and-What-Makes-It-So-Different"><a href="#Example-Click-Funnels-What-Is-It-and-What-Makes-It-So-Different" class="headerlink" title="Example: Click Funnels: What Is It and What Makes It So Different"></a>Example: Click Funnels: What Is It and What Makes It So Different</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kkSC7jdnf8" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kkSC7jdnf8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="4-Product-demonstrations"><a href="#4-Product-demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4.

Most of the professionals advise to invest on good quality camera lenses because they offer longer lifespan. You will be glad to know that lenses that have been designed years ago can be easily mounted on latest camera units and they still ensure outstanding results.</p><p> Those who are planning to buy new camera lenses may be little confused while making understanding for the basic specifications and features. If so, then the article below can be helpful for you as it contains details about best lenses for 4k cameras.</p><h2 id="How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?"></a>How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?</h2><h4 id="1-Lens-Mount"><a href="#1-Lens-Mount" class="headerlink" title="1.Lens Mount"></a>1.Lens Mount</h4><p> One of the most essential accessories for your camera lenses are mounts. All designers offer different mount systems for attaching lenses to the cameras so you can easily find a wide range of mount systems that are dedicated for DSLRs or to the mirror less systems like Micro Four Thirds, Sony E Mount, Nikon F and Canon EF. Few latest lenses also offer advanced features like making electrical contacts so that lens information gets automatically transferred to camera circuitry. It can also have a square type groove in the middle portion that works like a holder for filters.</p><h4 id="2-Sensor-Size"><a href="#2-Sensor-Size" class="headerlink" title="2. Sensor Size"></a>2. Sensor Size</h4><p> One more essential factor that demands your attention at the time of lens purchase is the camera sensor format. You can find a wide range of sensors in market ranging between Micro Four Thirds, Crop Sensors and Full Frame type. The full frame sensors use to be the largest ones and they are designed to cover the full frame and they ensure larger image size even on smaller sensors. But, in case if you prefer to use a crop type sensor on your full frame camera then it will deliver an image as per size of sensor only. The idea is to avoid using smaller sensors on a large format type camera but in few special cases when you want to access certain specific look then they can be connected.</p><h4 id="3-Lens-Adapters"><a href="#3-Lens-Adapters" class="headerlink" title="3. Lens Adapters"></a>3. Lens Adapters</h4><p> If you have lens that is dedicated to work with certain specific mount type but now need to connect it on different mount then lens adapter can solve your trouble. You can find these adapters for all mount types but still there are few cons hidden behind their usage. Most of these adapters block the ability of digital communication between lenses and camera. The fact is that when you lose the digital contact then it is not possible to access autofocus feature; even the new lenses may also suffer with inability to adjust the aperture. Adapters also cause disturbance to the light that passes from lens to sensor that reduces the quality of exposure.</p><h4 id="4-Focal-Length"><a href="#4-Focal-Length" class="headerlink" title="4.Focal Length"></a>4.Focal Length</h4><p> Here is one more important factor that you need to consider while buying camera lenses. Your will find camera focal length as first most parameter listed in the specification list of the device. This length is measured on millimetres scale and when it has lower value that means you will have wider viewing angle; naturally it will capture a wide scene. When lenses have longer focal length then viewers are able to find themselves nearer to the field they are shooting. Generally, the prime lenses offer fixed focal length value but zoom lenses offer a wider range.</p><h2 id="Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production"><a href="#Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production" class="headerlink" title="Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production"></a>Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production</h2><p> First of all, let us collect an idea about the major differences between still and cine lenses as it will help you to make better decision.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Quest-for-Immersion-Reviewing-BenQ’s-Ultra-HD-SW320"><a href="#The-Quest-for-Immersion-Reviewing-BenQ’s-Ultra-HD-SW320" class="headerlink" title="The Quest for Immersion: Reviewing BenQ’s Ultra HD SW320"></a>The Quest for Immersion: Reviewing BenQ’s Ultra HD SW320</h2><h1 id="BenQ-SW320-4K-31-5-inch-Monitor-Review"><a href="#BenQ-SW320-4K-31-5-inch-Monitor-Review" class="headerlink" title="BenQ SW320 4K 31.5-inch Monitor Review"></a>BenQ SW320 4K 31.5-inch Monitor Review</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Max-Wales"><a href="#Max-Wales" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Professional photographers in search of a wide color gamut 4k monitor will find few as effective and as competitively priced as the BenQ SW320. It delivers brilliantly on some key features visual professionals want including an impressive 31.5-inch display, an IPS LCD, HDR 10 support, high-level color accuracy and depth, and the latest in DisplayPort technology.</p><p> The BenQ SW320 monitor started making waves long before it hit the market. That’s because it proposed to offer premium visual rendering functionality for a quarter of the price of its nearest high-end competitor. At roughly $1500, the SW320 is a steal for visual professionals who are keen to improve their workflow while remaining on the cutting edge of their practice.</p><p> Its 3840 x 2160px 4K display does require a powerful graphics processor to reach peak performance. The good news is that the cost of high-level graphic processing is on a downward trajectory. With a top performing monitor like the BenQ SW320, professional photographers, videographers and graphic artists can work with colors and details that are on par with nature’s artistry and their lofty creative aspirations.</p><h2 id="BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> This monitor has many positives to tally. The most notable has to be its state-of-the-art input port technologies. It sports an HDMI 2.0 port, a DisplayPort 1.4 and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. These input sockets have the necessary bandwidth to support its 4k UHD screen, its high-fidelity color renditions and its HDR functionality.</p><p> Also worthy of note is its effective stand which lets users adjust the positioning of the screen for best viewing results. On its stand, the BenQ SW320 monitor can make a 20-degree upward tilt, a 45-degree right or left swivel, and a 90-degree pivot from landscape to portrait mode.</p><p> The swivel feature does fall short of what professional studio designers may require. A photographer who needs to swivel the monitor to show a colleague her work may find a 45-degree swivel insufficient.</p><p> Another significant downside has to do with uniformity across its screen. According to some testers, the SW320 shows noticeable color tints towards the edges when set to display all-white. This is perceptible even when its Brightness Uniformity feature is enabled. While uniformity is something most monitors fail to achieve 100%, it’s not out of place to expect that a monitor as powerful and as groundbreaking as the BenQ SW320 would succeed where others have not.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The design of the BenQ SW320 is ideal for Professional photographers. It has a minimal black finish with an optimal bezel size and a matte screen surface that minimizes harsh glare.</p><p> The SW320 also has the right support apparatus. As mentioned above, it ships with a very efficient stand that provides ample support for its relatively heavy bulk. It is also a VESA compatible monitor. This means that it has standardized slots designed to let it be mounted on a wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button"                ></p><p> The most novel design feature of the SW320 is the remote-control Puck which stows seamlessly in a round slot located at the base of its stand. The puck connects to the back of the monitor and is a great convenience utility. It has the right size and bulk to fit effortlessly into any visual professional’s workflow while providing quick access to OSD menus.</p><p> With so much going for it, the BenQ SW320 has yet another functional tool many pros are sure to appreciate. It comes with a Monitor Shading Hood that blocks stray light from altering the color accuracy of images on its screen.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-ports.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-ports"                ></p><p> As discussed earlier, the SW320 is fitted with the latest input port technologies. Its HDMI 2.O port, Display port 1.4 and mini DisplayPort 1.4 are located at the lower back side of the monitor. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an AC power cable slot also located at its lower back side. The HDMI 2.0 port enables HDR support while the DisplayPort 1.4 enables full 10-bit color displays. To access these ports conveniently, users need only swivel the monitor slightly in the clockwise direction until the input panel is plainly in view.</p><p> In addition to having the right input slots to support its high-level visual performance, the SW320 also has 2 USB 3.0 slots and one SD Card slot located on its left side. BenQ takes the guesswork out of using these input slots correctly by supplying the right cables. Furthermore, there’s a cable management hole built into its stand that makes keeping a tidy set up very easy.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Color-Performance"><a href="#1-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Color Performance"></a>1. Color Performance</h4><p> High-level color performance is a major strong suit of the BenQ SW320. When it comes to the number of colors it can render, this monitor packs a powerful punch. It can display a staggering 1.07 billion colors in multiple color gamuts. It is also Technicolor certified for both color accuracy and consistency.</p><p> It supports 10-bit color display and a 14-bit color LUT, and can render 99% of the sRGB color gamut as well as 99% of the AdobeRGB color gamut. Its coverage of the AdobeRGB gamut is particularly significant because AdobeRGB has an extended blue and green gamut compared to sRGB. As a result, AdobeRGB is better at rendering colors from nature.</p><p> AdobeRGB and sRGB aside, this monitor also has additional built-in color modes such as Black and White, DCI-P3, HDR and CAD&#x2F;CAM.</p><p> What’s really impressive is how easy it is to compare images in 2 color modes on the SW320. With Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture settings, a professional photographer can compare images in different color modes side-by-side. Enabling the PIP&#x2F;PBP feature through the HotKey Puck or joystick activates BenQ’s proprietary GamutDuo. GamutDuo is the feature which supports this on-screen color-mode comparison feature.</p><p> The SW320’s HDR support is another remarkable color performance feature. High Dynamic Rate support makes it possible to render more colors in the black and white range. It’s an all-important feature of High-Definition TVs. With this feature, the SW320 can achieve picture brilliance on par with HD-TV sets and other screens designed for entertainment purposes. This level of image quality enables professionals to produce top-quality work while also advancing the realm of possibility for their craft.</p><h4 id="2-Calibration"><a href="#2-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="2. Calibration"></a>2. Calibration</h4><p> Though most powerful monitors have what it takes to render colors accurately, how well they achieve this level of performance will depend on how well and how often they’re calibrated. The same is true for the SW320 which supports external hardware calibration. BenQ has a proprietary color calibration software known as Palette Master Element. This software works well with a number of external calibration devices such as X-Rite, Spyder and Display Pro. Using the software and hardware together, the SW320 can be set to perform at optimal color fidelity and depth.</p><p> Before calibrating any BenQ SW320 straight out of the box, it’s a good idea to go over the individual performance report that ships with it. Each report is unique. It provides a reliable baseline for understanding and assessing an SW320’s performance over time. Beyond its utility, these reports are also a good indication of BenQ’s commitment to quality and excellence.</p><h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p> One could argue that the effectiveness of a device’s assembly manual is a good measure of how well it is designed. In this regard, the BenQ SW320 scores another homerun. Its illustrated assembly manual is easy to follow. This allows for a stress-free set up experience that’s bound to be reassuring to anyone who’s spent $1500 on a monitor.</p><p> In the assembly manual, each part is labelled and arrows are used effectively to show how parts fit together. This clear sequencing means that most users can assemble their SW320s themselves. Granted its assembly manual makes setting up easy, there’s no shame in asking for help and doing some research. The SW320’s Monitor Shading Hood in particular, may prove a bit more difficult to assemble than the rest of the unit.</p><h4 id="4-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#4-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="4. Highlighted Features"></a>4. Highlighted Features</h4><p> Getting to know the strengths of the BenQ SW320 monitor is much like peeling back the layers of an onion. Many of its coolest features are nested within others and may not be apparent unless discussed. One such strength is the fact that due to its IPS LCD panel, the SW320 can display colors consistently at up to 178 degrees. This means that color depth and accuracy remain unchanged when this monitor is viewed from wide horizontally and vertically angles. This is certainly great for multi-viewer situations and in a way, compensates for the somewhat limited swivel angle of the SW320.</p><p> The Delta-E(ΔE) figures for this monitor are also very impressive and provide a sense of the high-level color fidelity it delivers consistently. Delta-E represents the difference between the color requested and the actual color rendered by the monitor. In general, figures under 2.0 are considered very good. According to some testers, the SW320 consistently scores a Delta-E that’s less than 1.2. This means that in many color modes, this monitor renders colors that are very true to what’s expected.</p><p> One last feature worth highlighting is the HotKey Puck’s custom option. It takes quick Display Menu access to a whole new level. While it is set by default to lead to standard menu options like Display, Color Adjustment and PIP&#x2F;PBP, the buttons on the Puck can actually be set to any functionality depending on what a user prefers. This includes custom color calibrations and any other custom settings a user may need in her workflow.</p><h4 id="5-Responsiveness"><a href="#5-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="5.Responsiveness"></a>5.Responsiveness</h4><p> As far as responsiveness goes, the SW320 is an okay performer. Its IPN LCD panel has a best response rate of 5ms. While this is great for rendering HD pictures and HD Video editing, it makes this monitor unsuited for quick-action gaming. Gaming monitors tend to have TN LCD panels precisely because they afford an excellent 1ms response rate that ensures screen-tearing and stuttering are minimized.</p><p> With its 5ms response rate, the SW320 may experience noticeable image rendering failures if used for fast-action gaming. For the most part however, this monitor performs exceedingly well for professional image processing and alright for minimal gaming use. It is worth emphasizing that the BenQ SW320 monitor is specifically designed to be used by visual design professionals. In light of this, its 5ms response rate is more than sufficient.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> We can all agree that the BenQ SW320 has an impressive roll of positives. Assessed by any standard, it performs superbly and delivers many pleasant surprises to boot.</p><p> With this monitor, users need not worry about being hampered by outdated hardware any time soon. The BenQ SW320 comes with the latest in display and input port technologies. Far from being left behind, the BenQ may up the demand for PCs that have powerful GPUs and the latest output ports.</p><p> For professional photographers, videographers and Graphic Designers, the SW320 is a dream. At an affordable price bracket of $1450 - $1500, this monitor puts state-of-the-art color processing features within reach. And with proprietary features like GamutDuo and Palette Master Element, Visual Professionals can optimize their workflow significantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-power-of-popularity-in-stock-images-and-stories/"><u>2024 Approved  The Power of Popularity in Stock Images & Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unlocking-phantom-the-slow-motion-essentials-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Phantom  The Slow-Motion Essentials for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/synthesize-music-with-images-in-ppts-for-2024/"><u>Synthesize Music with Images in PPTs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-your-ideal-vr-gear-selection-would-you-prefer-the-ease-of-mobile-or-tethered-setup/"><u>[New] Unveiling Your Ideal VR Gear Selection  Would You Prefer the Ease of Mobile or Tethered Setup?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unzip-the-scripts-crafting-subtitles-from-compressed-files/"><u>[New] Unzip the Scripts  Crafting Subtitles From Compressed Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-top-10-free-to-use-game-soundtracks-online/"><u>[New] Top 10 Free-to-Use Game Soundtracks Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-understanding-consumer-behavior-a-guide-for-market-researchers/"><u>In 2024, Understanding Consumer Behavior  A Guide for Market Researchers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-framework-for-finding-the-right-podcast-title-plus-idea-compendium/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Framework for Finding the Right Podcast Title + Idea Compendium</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-blueprint-of-writing-appealing-vlog-storylines/"><u>2024 Approved  The Blueprint of Writing Appealing Vlog Storylines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-techniques-for-enhancing-your-instagram-videos/"><u>In 2024, Essential Techniques for Enhancing Your Instagram Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pop-sync-streamlining-song-placement-on-instagram-stories/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Pop Sync  Streamlining Song Placement on Instagram Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-educational-gaming-content-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Educational Gaming Content on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/syncopated-mix-management-in-sonar-by-platinum/"><u>Syncopated Mix Management in Sonar by Platinum</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-digital-training-footage/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Digital Training Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-android-sim-unlock-code-generators-unlock-your-nokia-c02-phone-hassle-free-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Best Android SIM Unlock Code Generators Unlock Your Nokia C02 Phone Hassle-Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-finding-balance-the-art-of-choosing-video-dimensions/"><u>2024 Approved  Finding Balance  The Art of Choosing Video Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-expert-take-on-acid-pro-and-competitive-analysis/"><u>[Updated] Expert Take on ACID Pro and Competitive Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleashing-potential-the-rising-stars-of-women-in-video-content/"><u>2024 Approved  Unleashing Potential  The Rising Stars of Women in Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/frp-hijacker-by-hagard-download-and-bypass-your-realme-12-proplus-5g-frp-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>FRP Hijacker by Hagard Download and Bypass your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G FRP Locks</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?"></a>Part 2. How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?</h2><p>The best way to present any news related to any sports event is to create a short video containing all the highlights of the event. For example, you can create a video combining all the highlights of short track speed skating 2022 that we have presented in the previous section. You can also collect short clips of the event from social media platforms that have been captured by audiences.</p><p>To create such a highlight video on any sports event, there are certain videos effects commonly used that you should know about.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong> – Since you are going to use a lot of still photos, the transition from one photo to another should be smooth. This is where transition effects come into the play so that the viewer does not feel any jarring effect and sudden changes as they move from one slide in your video to another.</p><p><strong>Slow Motion</strong> – If you have collected from short clips of the event, you can use slow motion effect to prolong the clip and give enough time for your viewer to watch it. Slow motion effect is quite captivating and intriguing in today’s videography world.</p><p><strong>Motion Tracking</strong> – Using motion tracking, you can track the movement of a particular object or athlete in a video. This helps to attach certain elements such as clipart, text, icon to that particular athlete throughout the video for easy identification by the viewers.</p><p><strong>Pan and Zoom</strong> – Pan and Zoom is the most commonly used video effect that is applied to still footage. While the footage zooms out, texts and titles are shown or a voiceover is played so that the graphic on the screen does not stay static.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional Video Editor</h3><p>To create a video based on any sport event such as short track speed skating highlights, you need a professional video editor where you can get all the video effects and elements in one place.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Manipulating-Image-Shapes"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Manipulating-Image-Shapes" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to Manipulating Image Shapes"></a>The Ultimate Guide to Manipulating Image Shapes</h2><p>In this Photoshop tutorial, we’re going to carve an image using four simple steps. Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas. If the document’s size does not match that of the image, you will see a transformation box surrounding the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/place-image-in-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="place image in photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Warp-the-Image"><a href="#Step3Warp-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step3Warp the Image"></a>Step3Warp the Image</h5><p>Now we’ll curve the image using the Warp Tool. Select the Warp Tool by clicking and holding on the Transform Tool in the toolbar. The Warp Tool is located at the bottom of the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+T or Command+T on your keyboard to open the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu and then select the Warp Tool from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/wrap-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="wrap image photoshop"                ></p><p>With the Warp Tool selected, hover your cursor over the image. You’ll see a grid appear over the image. Click and drag one of the middle nodes in the horizontal direction to begin curving the image. As you drag, you’ll see the image curve along with your cursor. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of curvature, simply press and hold the Shift key while dragging the node.</p><p>Play around with the settings in the options bar. There are quite a few different looks you can achieve just by adjusting these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-image-height-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change image height photoshop"                ></p><p>20% <strong>Horizontal Distortion</strong> makes one side of the image appear larger than the other. This is what my photo looks like at 20%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-horizontal-distortion-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change horizontal distortion photoshop"                ></p><p><strong>Vertical Distortion</strong> makes the image look as if it’s leaning backward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/verticle-distortion-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="verticle distortion image photoshop"                ></p><p>The <strong>Bend Direction</strong> option rotates the angle of the bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/bend-direction-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="bend direction image photoshop"                ></p><p>Flip any of these effects in the opposite direction by placing a negative sign in front of the percentage. Here’s -20% in the <strong>Bend</strong> box with a vertical bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flip-effect-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="flip effect image photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Save-the-Image"><a href="#Step4Save-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step4Save the Image"></a>Step4Save the Image</h5><p>Once you’re happy with the way your image looks, go to File &gt; Save As in the menu bar or press Ctrl+Shift+S or Command+Shift+S on your keyboard. Choose a file format and location to save your image and click Save. And that’s it! You’ve successfully curved</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/save-curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="save curve image photoshop"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this post has helped you learn how to curve an image in Photoshop.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Right-Platform-for-Content-Creation-Podcast-or-Video"><a href="#The-Right-Platform-for-Content-Creation-Podcast-or-Video" class="headerlink" title="The Right Platform for Content Creation? Podcast or Video?"></a>The Right Platform for Content Creation? Podcast or Video?</h2><p>When choosing which media to use, there are a few different options. In the battle of podcast vs. YouTube, which one would you pick? One or both? You may upload videos on YouTube or create podcasts.</p><p>One reason to use Spotify for podcasts is that it’s a global platform, meaning your podcast can be heard by a large audience worldwide.</p><p>Spotify is a popular platform, so listeners will likely discover your podcast through them. Putting out a video on YouTube is more work than creating a podcast; however, it may be rewarding. Read and find which one is the best!</p><h2 id="A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube"><a href="#A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube"></a>A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube</h2><p>There’s no denying that YouTube is one of the most popular online platforms. Millions of people use it daily to watch videos on everything from current events to how-to guides.</p><p>But YouTube isn’t the only game in town regarding online video.</p><p>Podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among people who commute or have long car journeys. So, which is better - YouTube or podcasts?</p><p>There’s a massive range of content available on YouTube. No matter your interests, you’re sure to find something to watch. YouTube videos are usually shorter than podcasts, so they’re perfect for busy people who don’t have time to commit to an extended episode.</p><p>You can watch YouTube videos on your phone or tablet, even if you’re not connected to the internet. So it is perfect for when you’re on the go. Now talking about podcasts, they can be downloaded and listened to offline, so you can listen even if you’re not connected to the internet.</p><p>The difference between podcasts and YouTube is that Podcasts are usually longer than YouTube videos. So they can be great for getting in-depth information on a topic. In addition, you may listen to podcasts while doing other things, such as driving or cooking.</p><p>Lately, investing your time in creating a meaningful video podcast makes more sense. The editing process of a podcast will be simpler than editing a YouTube video.

This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file.

To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.</p><p>Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.</p><p>This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.</p><p>Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.</p><h2 id="Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube"><a href="#Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube"></a>Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube</h2><p>There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.</p><p>However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you’re talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.</p><p>Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don’t have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don’t spend much time on their channels.</p><p>There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships. Furthermore, you may get famous and get invited to events.</p><h2 id="Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content"><a href="#Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content" class="headerlink" title="Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content"></a>Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content</h2><p>When it comes to deciding how to share your content on podcast vs. YouTube, there are a few things you’ll want to consider.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the goal?</strong> The first thing you’ll want to determine is the goal of sharing your content. Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?</li><li>The second factor you’ll want to consider is <strong>your audience size and engagement</strong>. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?</li><li><strong>What format should your content be in?</strong> For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?</li><li><strong>You’ll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.</strong> Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?</li><li><strong>Pick the right niche.</strong> For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.</li><li><strong>You’ll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.</strong> If you’re creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.</li><li><strong>Focus on building skills.</strong> If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.</li><li><strong>How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.</strong> So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.</li></ol><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video?

Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views"                ></p><p>On the downside, podcasts generally don’t have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel “cheap” or “amateurish.” On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators’ higher level of investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify"                ></p><p>YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video. However, YouTube videos can be much more explanatory than podcasts, making them less convenient to consume.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="writing a good description with tags will help get views"                ></p><h2 id="Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa-1"><a href="#Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa-1" class="headerlink" title="Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?"></a>Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?</h2><p>Many love podcasts. They have the convenience of being able to create and listen to podcasts on the go. And there are also a lot of people who love YouTube videos. They love the visuals and the ability to watch their favorite videos whenever possible.</p><p>So, what if you could combine these two? Can you transform a podcast into a YouTube video or vice versa? It turns out you can! There are a few different options, so you don’t have to choose between a podcast or YouTube.</p><p>If you have a podcast that you want to turn into a YouTube video, one option is to record the audio from the podcast and turn it into a video file. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record your podcast as you’re playing it. This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file. You can then share this MP3 file with your favorite podcasting platform.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record the video as you’re playing it. This will give you an audio file of the video and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this audio file to your favorite podcasting platform and share it with the world.</p><p>Lastly, you may present a podcast on your webcam and record the video and audio for YouTube. Meanwhile, use the audio to upload as a podcast. Then, your listeners and viewers can watch the video and listen to the podcast on the go.</p><p>And if you have a podcast that’s doing well, you can create a YouTube video series based on it. Alternatively, if you have a popular YouTube channel, you can create a podcast based on your videos.</p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode-1"><a href="#What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode"></a>What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode</h2><p><strong>Pros and Cons of a YouTube video:</strong></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>No physical office is required.

One way is to use Google AdSense. With AdSense, you can place ad units on your videos and earn money based on the traffic your videos generate.</p><p>Another way to monetize your content is by selling products or services through videos and podcasts. For example, you can use a platform like Gumroad to sell digital products or a service like Patreon to sell memberships or access exclusive content.</p><p>You can also use your YouTube channel and podcast to drive your website or blog traffic. You can then monetize your website or blog through advertising, affiliate marketing, or selling products and services.</p><p>Whatever approach you take, make sure that you are providing value to your audience. For example, if your videos and podcasts are helpful and informative, people will be more likely to watch and listen, and you’ll be more likely to monetize your content successfully.</p><h2 id="Podcast-vs-YouTube-What-Are-the-Current-Industry-Trends-1"><a href="#Podcast-vs-YouTube-What-Are-the-Current-Industry-Trends-1" class="headerlink" title="Podcast vs. YouTube: What Are the Current Industry Trends"></a>Podcast vs. YouTube: What Are the Current Industry Trends</h2><p>The current industry trends for podcasts vs. YouTube are different. To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.</p><p>Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.</p><p>This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.</p><p>Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.</p><h2 id="Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube-1"><a href="#Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube"></a>Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube</h2><p>There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.</p><p>However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you’re talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.</p><p>Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don’t have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don’t spend much time on their channels.</p><p>There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships. Furthermore, you may get famous and get invited to events.</p><h2 id="Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content-1"><a href="#Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content"></a>Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content</h2><p>When it comes to deciding how to share your content on podcast vs. YouTube, there are a few things you’ll want to consider.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the goal?</strong> The first thing you’ll want to determine is the goal of sharing your content. Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?</li><li>The second factor you’ll want to consider is <strong>your audience size and engagement</strong>. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?</li><li><strong>What format should your content be in?</strong> For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?</li><li><strong>You’ll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.</strong> Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?</li><li><strong>Pick the right niche.</strong> For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.</li><li><strong>You’ll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.</strong> If you’re creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.</li><li><strong>Focus on building skills.</strong> If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.</li><li><strong>How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.</strong> So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.</li></ol><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video? That depends on your personal preferences. If you’d like to create in-depth, topic-focused content, podcasts are probably a better choice.</p><p>If you prefer to create playful and exciting content, then vlogs might be more your thing. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide which format you prefer. You may start with the easier one and learn how to create both podcasts and YouTube videos simultaneously.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/top-5-homemade-shot-strategies-the-fastest-hacks-you-need-for-2024/"><u>Top 5 Homemade Shot Strategies – The Fastest Hacks You Need for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/inshots-ecosystem-a-detailed-editor-app-study-for-2024/"><u>InShot’s Ecosystem  A Detailed Editor App Study for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-insiders-srt-primer-must-know-elements/"><u>In 2024, The Insider's SRT Primer  Must-Know Elements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-tailoring-visual-quality-choose-aspect-ratios-wisely/"><u>[New] Tailoring Visual Quality  Choose Aspect Ratios Wisely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/strategies-for-writing-persuasive-vlog-show-narratives-for-2024/"><u>Strategies for Writing Persuasive Vlog Show Narratives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-asus-proart-a-high-end-display/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to ASUS ProArt  A High-End Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-the-power-of-pixels-master-color-correction-techniques-11-steps/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlock the Power of Pixels - Master Color Correction Techniques (11 Steps)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-toolwiz-demystified-detailed-app-evaluation-for-photo-experts/"><u>2024 Approved  Toolwiz Demystified  Detailed App Evaluation for Photo Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-improving-online-sessions-with-increased-zoom/"><u>2024 Approved  Improving Online Sessions with Increased Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/building-a-professional-online-network-hub/"><u>Building a Professional Online Network Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-curate-engaging-content-with-top-igtv-editor-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Curate Engaging Content with Top IGTV Editor Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/why-is-my-nokia-c210-offline-troubleshooting-guide-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Why Is My Nokia C210 Offline?

However, if you would like to be a part of a new gaming community and have access to the MacOS feature, then Mixer stream can work for you.</p><p>Section1. <a href="#mixer-vs-twitch">Mixer VS Twitch</a></p><p>Section2. <a href="#steps-of-stream-on-mixer-via-macbook">Steps of Stream on Mixer via MacBook</a></p><p>Between Mixer stream and Twitch stream, one will absolutely be better for your personal style. So which is better? Let’s compare Mixer and Twitch to help you decide which is best for you.</p><h2 id="Section-1-Mixer-VS-Twitch"><a href="#Section-1-Mixer-VS-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Mixer VS Twitch"></a>Section 1. Mixer VS Twitch</h2><ul><li>What is Mixer?</li></ul><p>Mixer steam was initially known as Beam when it was introduced in 2016. A few months later, Microsoft gained the streaming service and renamed it to the Mixer. And only a few months later the company announced that the service will become a built-in feature on Windows 10. Mixer stream is a live streaming platform, similar to Twitch, that is most commonly used for live broadcasts of gaming videos, although you can create your own podcasts or streams centered on any other topic you like.</p><p>Streaming on Mixer can require a little effort, and you must make sure you have all the right software like OBS before you begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/mixer.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li>What is Twitch?</li></ul><p>Twitch is a leading live streaming platform founded in 2011 with the main purpose being video games. It initially started as a spinoff division of Justin.tv, with gaming being the main priority. The platform allows users to interact with others, play games and stream their own games. Almost anything you would like to watch is available. In any Twitch channel, a streamer normally inlays a webcam video and interacts with their viewers with an IRC-style chat-room and a microphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/twitch.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Both of them are the most common gaming streaming platforms, but there are still some differences.</p><p><strong>Because of FTL technology, Mixer live streaming is a bit faster than Twitch.</strong> On stream, there is less than a second of delay. While on Twitch, the delay can go up to 20 seconds, hence making it difficult to interact with a viewer. However, <strong>Twitch VODs are easier to record and navigate.</strong> Also, the Twitch dashboard is very powerful, with good analytics.</p><p>On Twitch, streamers can earn money through micro-donation, subscriptions, and advertisements. It allows viewers to subscribe for free to streamers once a month. On the other hand, Mixer stream offers “embers”. Users can donate these embers to any streamer. Therefore, streamers can make money right away which is not the case with Twitch that requires you to meet affiliate requirements before you make any money.</p><p>Twitch has the largest number of streamers. It is hard to get noticed on Twitch because it can showcase many streamers at once. Also, Twitch stream is older, which makes it have many viewers. Many users already know their favorite streamers and are probably not looking for more. For a new streamer, it can take time before you become a Twitch partner, which is not the case with the Mixer stream because of less competition.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Steps-of-Stream-on-Mixer-via-MacBook"><a href="#Section-2-Steps-of-Stream-on-Mixer-via-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

This desktop program can change your live voice to match your desired online character, whether voice chatting on Skype and Discord or playing on Steam and Valorant. But if you’re looking to use MorphVOX, it’s paramount to know that this program comes in two packages, the Junior and Pro versions. So, what’s the difference between the Junior and Pro versions? Let’s find out<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Try AI Voice Changer"                > For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-MorphVOX-Junior-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What is MorphVOX Junior voice changer?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer" >MorphVOX Junior <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free, open-source voice changer for Windows systems. This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.</p><p>You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.</p><p>However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That’s because it’s pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it’s an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-1.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What is MorphVOX Pro voice changer?</h2><p>If you’re unsatisfied with MorphVOX Junior, purchase <a class="link"   href="https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer" >MorphVOX Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for $39.99 only. Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It’s super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.</p><p>But the Junior version doesn’t come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-2.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to use MorphVOX Junior to change voices on Discord. For those who don’t know, Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP app where users can share voice calls, video calls, media, and text messages. Although it’s compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, we’ll learn how to use it on Windows PC. Now follow me!</p><p>Step1 Assuming you already have a Discord account, head straight to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Junior.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-3.jpg"                      alt="download morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><p>Step2 Once the app is up and running, head to Discord and click the <strong>User Settings</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-4.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior open discord settings"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, tap <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> before choosing the <strong>Input Device</strong> as <strong>Screaming Bee Audio</strong>. You can also adjust <strong>Input Sensitivity</strong> by disabling the feature and then speak to your mic to change the sensitivity accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-5.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior choose discord input"                ></p><p>Step4 Lastly, head to MorphVOX voice changer and choose a magic voice.

So, in this section, we want to learn how to use <strong>MorphVOX on Mac</strong>. I guess that means purchasing the Pro version. However, you’ll enjoy unlimited voice-changing capabilities.

Most of the professionals advise to invest on good quality camera lenses because they offer longer lifespan. You will be glad to know that lenses that have been designed years ago can be easily mounted on latest camera units and they still ensure outstanding results.</p><p> Those who are planning to buy new camera lenses may be little confused while making understanding for the basic specifications and features. If so, then the article below can be helpful for you as it contains details about best lenses for 4k cameras.</p><h2 id="How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-lens-for-your-4k-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?"></a>How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?</h2><h4 id="1-Lens-Mount"><a href="#1-Lens-Mount" class="headerlink" title="1.Lens Mount"></a>1.Lens Mount</h4><p> One of the most essential accessories for your camera lenses are mounts. All designers offer different mount systems for attaching lenses to the cameras so you can easily find a wide range of mount systems that are dedicated for DSLRs or to the mirror less systems like Micro Four Thirds, Sony E Mount, Nikon F and Canon EF. Few latest lenses also offer advanced features like making electrical contacts so that lens information gets automatically transferred to camera circuitry. It can also have a square type groove in the middle portion that works like a holder for filters.</p><h4 id="2-Sensor-Size"><a href="#2-Sensor-Size" class="headerlink" title="2. Sensor Size"></a>2. Sensor Size</h4><p> One more essential factor that demands your attention at the time of lens purchase is the camera sensor format. You can find a wide range of sensors in market ranging between Micro Four Thirds, Crop Sensors and Full Frame type. The full frame sensors use to be the largest ones and they are designed to cover the full frame and they ensure larger image size even on smaller sensors. But, in case if you prefer to use a crop type sensor on your full frame camera then it will deliver an image as per size of sensor only. The idea is to avoid using smaller sensors on a large format type camera but in few special cases when you want to access certain specific look then they can be connected.</p><h4 id="3-Lens-Adapters"><a href="#3-Lens-Adapters" class="headerlink" title="3. Lens Adapters"></a>3. Lens Adapters</h4><p> If you have lens that is dedicated to work with certain specific mount type but now need to connect it on different mount then lens adapter can solve your trouble. You can find these adapters for all mount types but still there are few cons hidden behind their usage. Most of these adapters block the ability of digital communication between lenses and camera. The fact is that when you lose the digital contact then it is not possible to access autofocus feature; even the new lenses may also suffer with inability to adjust the aperture. Adapters also cause disturbance to the light that passes from lens to sensor that reduces the quality of exposure.</p><h4 id="4-Focal-Length"><a href="#4-Focal-Length" class="headerlink" title="4.Focal Length"></a>4.Focal Length</h4><p> Here is one more important factor that you need to consider while buying camera lenses. Your will find camera focal length as first most parameter listed in the specification list of the device. This length is measured on millimetres scale and when it has lower value that means you will have wider viewing angle; naturally it will capture a wide scene. When lenses have longer focal length then viewers are able to find themselves nearer to the field they are shooting. Generally, the prime lenses offer fixed focal length value but zoom lenses offer a wider range.</p><h2 id="Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production"><a href="#Best-Lenses-for-4k-Camera-Professional-Production" class="headerlink" title="Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production"></a>Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production</h2><p> First of all, let us collect an idea about the major differences between still and cine lenses as it will help you to make better decision. The cine lenses are designed with robust construction and they offer lower tolerance range for all specifications.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Spectrum’s-Impact-Applying-Color-Dynamics"><a href="#The-Spectrum’s-Impact-Applying-Color-Dynamics" class="headerlink" title="The Spectrum’s Impact: Applying Color Dynamics"></a>The Spectrum’s Impact: Applying Color Dynamics</h2><p>So, you’ve heard about color theory but don’t know what it is or how to use it and you may also be wondering what color theory could possibly have to do with you. We are talking about the theory of all color combinations and how they can be altered or selected to better work together creating a more pleasant viewing for your audience.</p><p>If you are more selective with your colors in your videos or imagery the viewer will find this aesthetically pleasing and may be more engaged in your content. This includes anything from logo design all the way to props for your shot. When creating your videos within Filmora it is good practice to think about your composition in all aspects including color theory and with the guide hopefully you will have a better understanding of how you can influence your color palette.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Color-Theory"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Theory"></a>What Is Color Theory</h2><p>Color theory consists of many elements that could fill a library on its own but for this guide we will focus on two key elements. The color wheel and color harmony. By understanding the color wheel and color harmony you can hand pick which colors to add or use in your pieces to create a well-balanced viewing experience which can help in viewer engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>There are many color wheels out there and all require understanding and research into that particular color arrangement but for this guide I will be focusing on the more widely used RGB which derives from the primary colors red green and blue, If you’re thinking why red green and blue not red yellow and blue then you are observant, while RYB is taught as the three primary colors we will be using what is known as additive primary colors of light meaning the more you add of these colors the closer to white you get, the reason we will be using this combination is due to the fact RYB misses a lot of hues around the violet area and the blue-greens meaning we achieve a higher range of color to pick from. With this in mind let’s start.</p><h2 id="The-Color-Wheel"><a href="#The-Color-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="The Color Wheel"></a>The Color Wheel</h2><p>Using red, green and blue as primary colors we can mix the colors to one another to get our secondary colors giving us yellow, magenta and cyan. We can mix these to one another to create our tertiary colors which are raspberry, orange, sprig green, turquoise, ocean and violet giving us something which looks like this</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/color-wheel.jpg"                      alt="colcor wheel"                ></p><p>As you can see, we have every color available in this wheel and they are arranged in a unison with the mixed colors starting with red, green and blue and working towards each other.</p><h2 id="Color-Harmony"><a href="#Color-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="Color Harmony"></a>Color Harmony</h2><p>So now we know how the wheel is made and what it looks like. What does it do? We can use this wheel now to gather our palette. Within color theory we talk about harmonious colors that work together in a pleasant way creating less stress on the eyes to find information in your scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-harmony.jpg"                      alt="color harmony"                ></p><p>One such harmony is complementary colors and luckily for us this is very easy to find. You take your base color and find the opposite color on the wheel. In this example the complementary color to blue is yellow depicted with a red line.</p><p>These colors always work as they create contrast and stability.</p><p>The blue lines represent what is known as split contrasting colors and these will create balance with each other.</p><p>The corners of the black rectangle land on what is known as tetradic complement and allows you to add four colors with the understanding that they will complement each other perfectly. Lastly is the purple line which represents the analogous complementary colors, you can pick these neighboring colors with the peace of mind that they will harmonize with each other. There are many more but these four are the main ones that you will use more often than any other, by selecting colors using these four main types you can create a palette for your scenes and allow the viewer to effortlessly enjoy your content. These types work no matter where you start from on the wheel so long as you keep the distances the same.</p><h2 id="But-How-Do-I-Use-This"><a href="#But-How-Do-I-Use-This" class="headerlink" title="But How Do I Use This"></a>But How Do I Use This</h2><p>You may still be unsure as to how to implement color theory into your videos. Let’s look at some scenarios that color theory may help your creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-theory-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color theory video"                ></p><p>In this scene the director decided that the backdrop should complement the top the actor is wearing, looking at our wheel we can see the complementary color would be dark purple so they started with that, to create a more dynamic scene they then used the analogous colors of that purple being pink and red and created the backdrop. This creates a harmony within the scene and makes it effortless to see all the key elements straight away.</p><p>As you can see from this example the base color for the scene is a dark blue&#x2F;purple and using the analogous color of pink they created a point of interest within the scene that doesn’t look out of place. This is a very good way to pull the viewers eyes towards something you want them to take in above all else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/movie-cover-with-color-theory.jpg"                      alt="movie cover with color theory"                ></p><p>As you can see from all the movie covers above, they all use complementary colors from the blues to the war yellows and oranges, this creates high contrast and balance and is something done within the movie industry in every scene. It’s no coincidence that the joker is purple and green or that the iron man is red and gold, this is well prepared and researched in the planning stages of everything a visual artist creates.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>By including this into your thought process when creating videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will achieve well balanced and harmonious content for your viewer to enjoy and create better engagement. It’s not by chance these things happen though, it’s through research and planning that the most iconic scenes and characters are created and this is just one small brick in the foundations of content creation.
