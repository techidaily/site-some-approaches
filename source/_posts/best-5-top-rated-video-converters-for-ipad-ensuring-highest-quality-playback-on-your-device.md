## No.2: HandBrake

Being famous as a piece of cross-platform open-source DVD video processing software, Handbrake is definitely the best video converter for iPad, iPhone iPod users. Its output presets are mostly Apple related gadgets like iPhone, iPad and iPod. But Handbrake only claims to convert video to **MP4 and MKV** formats, making it fall behind MacX Video Converter Pro. That is why Handbrake is our silver award winner in the best iPad video encoder review.

## No.3: Aimersoft Video Converter 

Like MacX, Aimersoft Video Converter has nearly all the features you could want in video to iPad conversion. As another top video to iPad converter program, it excels in converting any video into formats that can run on this Apple iPad tablet. It also comes in handy for extracting audio in format like MP3, AAC, etc to make them compatible with the iPad. The only major drawback in this top-rated video converter for iPad is its promiscuous interface. It takes us several minutes to figure out how to navigate between the editing tools screen and the main conversion screen. So if you're looking for a clean iPad video transcoder that's a little more intuitive to navigate, you'll need to head over to the former two apps.
