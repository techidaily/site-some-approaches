 While Google is renowned for its groundbreaking products, not all of its ventures have been successful. In fact, the tech giant has a graveyard of projects that it closed after operating them for years. Let's take a look at some of Google's notable failures and what led to their demise.

## 1  Google+ 

 Launched in 2011, Google+ was Google's attempt to [rival Facebook](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-master-the-art-of-mobile-movie-watching-with-top-10-ios-apps/) in the social networking space. However, it failed to gain much traction. The primary reason for its failure was its late entry into the market. By 2011, Facebook had already established a massive user base. Google’s efforts to integrate Google+ with its other services only added to users' confusion and frustration.

 While initially popular, features like Circles and Hangouts were not as user-friendly as alternatives such as Facebook Messenger. Google+ did not provide a compelling reason for users to switch from Facebook, and Facebook's momentum made it even more difficult. After nearly a decade of operation, Google+ was shut down in 2019.

## 2  Google Allo 

 Launched in 2016, Google Allo was a smart instant messaging app designed to [compete against WhatsApp](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-the-art-of-online-photo-trimming/), iMessage, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram. While Google did try to bring some unique features to the table, like integrating Google Assistant into chat conversations, it also had some odd deficits. For example, Allo only offered end-to-end encryption in Incognito mode, whereas it was a default feature in competing apps.

 The crowded messaging app market made it hard for Allo to gain market share. Also, the parallel development of overlapping apps, such as Hangouts, Duo, and Android Messages, diluted the focus on Allo, making it difficult for users to commit to one app. Despite its innovative features, these factors led to Google Allo's failure, and it was shut down in 2019.

## 3  Google Wave 

 Launched in 2010, Google Wave aimed to merge the functionality of email, instant messaging, wikis, and social networking into a single platform, allowing users to communicate and collaborate in real time. Although the product was highly innovative and ahead of its time, it was also very complicated to use.

 The steep learning curve led to low adoption, and the platform was plagued with bugs and lag issues. Additionally, the market was not ready for such an integrated tool. Users preferred dedicated solutions for their specific needs, such as [email services](https://location-social.techidaily.com/4-most-known-ways-to-find-someone-on-tinder-for-nokia-g310-by-name-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), messaging apps, and collaborative tools, rather than using all of these within Google Wave.

 Google Wave failed to clearly define its use case and did not receive sufficient adoption, leading to its closure in 2012.

## 4  Google Buzz 

 Launched in 2010, Google Buzz aimed to integrate social networking and microblogging into Gmail, allowing users to share photos, videos, and links with their contacts. However, its primary failure stemmed from a serious privacy misstep: Google automatically connected users with their frequent Gmail contacts, revealing sensitive connections.

 In contrast, Facebook and other competitors provided users with more control over their connections and shared content. They offered standalone products rather than forcibly integrating social networking into an existing platform. The integration also made the user interface too complex compared to what its competitors were offering.

 Many users viewed Google Buzz as an unwanted intrusion. The privacy concerns eroded user trust and hampered adoption, leading to its closure in 2011.

## 5  Google Glass 

 Launched in 2014, Google Glass was a wearable augmented reality device in the form of eyeglasses. It featured a small display, camera, and touchpad designed to provide users with access to navigation and messaging. Users could also take photos, record videos, and interact with apps through gestures and voice commands.

 Despite lacking a direct competitor, Google Glass failed for several reasons. The built-in camera raised privacy concerns, making users uncomfortable wearing it in public. The device had a short battery life and an unattractive design, and the added weight of the technology made it unsuitable for extended wear.

 Furthermore, its high price of $1500 made it one of the most expensive wearables on the market. Its practical applications were also limited, which led to minimal adoption. Due to these factors, the consumer version of Google Glass was shelved in 2015, though [it continued to be used in enterprise settings](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-smart-tips-for-gif-lovers-iphone-edition/).

## 6  Google Health 

 Launched in 2008, Google Health was a health data management product designed to securely store, manage, and share users' health information. Despite its potential, Google Health faced serious challenges. One of the primary issues was its difficulty integrating with existing electronic health record (EHR) systems used by healthcare providers.

 These systems were deeply embedded in healthcare workflows, leading to a reluctance among providers to adopt Google Health. Moreover, the platform proved too unwieldy for most users to navigate and understand. Another hurdle was the general skepticism among users about trusting a tech company with their sensitive healthcare data.

 Most users used to prefer traditional methods of managing health records over digital platforms. Additionally, navigating healthcare regulations added to the hurdles faced by Google in integrating its technology into the healthcare sector. Ultimately, these challenges contributed to Google's decision to shut down Google Health in 2012.

## 7  Google Daydream 

 Launched in 2016, Google Daydream was an ambitious virtual reality platform aimed at delivering a high-quality VR experience. It offered users access to a diverse range of VR content, including games, apps, and 360-degree videos through the Daydream app. However, it faced several challenges that impacted its adoption in the market.

 Unlike standalone VR headsets like those from Oculus (Facebook), Google Daydream relied on smartphones for processing power. This dependency limited its performance and graphical capabilities compared to dedicated VR devices. Also, issues such as smartphone overheating further hindered its popularity among users.

 The platform also struggled with a smaller library of VR content and failed to retain developers, which affected its growth. Moreover, the design of the Daydream View headset made it uncomfortable for extended use. Due to these factors, Google Daydream failed to achieve significant market penetration and was discontinued in 2019.

---

 While these are some of the notable Google failures, the company has shuttered hundreds of other projects over the past decade. Details of all 295 apps, services, and hardware failures can be found on the [Killed by Google website](https://killedbygoogle.com/). While these failures have cost the company billions of dollars, Google also has many successful products of which it can be proud.

 However, acknowledging that there is always room for new failures, Google should learn from past mistakes and ensure its successful ventures do not end up in the graveyard.
