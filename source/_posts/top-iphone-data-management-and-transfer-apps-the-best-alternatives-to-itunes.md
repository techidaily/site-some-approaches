## 1\. iTunes vs MacX MediaTrans: Interface Design 

 Apple claims to optimize iTunes with simpler interface. However, that doesn't really help. iTunes has more features added for you to not only organize your music, video, photos, iBooks, etc., but also buy TV shows, movies, apps and more thereon. That results in an unfocused, unituitive and confusing tool. No wonder almost every iTunes users complain a lot about **iTunes horrible interface**. And some radical users even asks Apple to do their a favor to kill the complicated iTunes.

Yet, what really depresses you is the unchanged confusing iTunes after all these years (18 years after its release). So instead of waiting for its change, a better solution is to apply a **user-friendly** iPhone manager software. MacX is up to the mark.

##  3\. iTunes vs MacX: Unidirectional vs Bi-directional Sync

In terms of iTunes sync and iTunes transfer errors, you iTunes users might have a laundry list of complaints to express. To sum up, they are mainly embodied in the following aspects:

1. [iPhone won't sync with iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). An unknown error occurred (-54).
2. "The iPhone (Name) is synced with another iTunes Library on (Computer). Do you want to erase this iPhone and sync with this iTunes Library?" However, the existing songs and videos on iPhone are missing after syncing with this iTunes library.
3. Unable to transfer files (music, video, pic...) from iPhone to Mac via iTunes. Only files sync from Mac to iPhone is supported.

## 4\. iTunes vs MacX MediaTrans: Data Backup 

It would always be better to make an iPhone backup as Plan B than no backup lest your iPhone is stolen or file data accidently gets lost. However, when it comes to use iTunes to backup your iPhone, there's high likelihood for you to be trapped into these troubles:

* iTunes cannot backup iPhone \[XXX\] because an error occurred or [iTunes backup couldn't be completed](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
* iTunes won't let me selectively backup my iPhone.
* Why does iTunes take a long time to backup my iPhone? My iPhone is taking forever to backup.
* The latest updated version of iTunes doesn't allow you to backup iTunes to another computer if your desktop fails unless you have purchased all the music from Apple.

![iTunes could not backup the iPhone](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/../itunes/article-image/itunes-backup-error.jpg) 

iTunes could not backup the iPhone

As for majority of iTunes users, iTunes seems still in its infancy after all these years. See, one of the top complaints about [iTunes errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)is still alive and those features it oughts to develop still have nothing to do with it. Under such conditions, there is little you can do to make iTunes work smoothly or let it do what it can't do. Instead, you can count on **best iTunes alternative** from MacX because whatever demands you have can be well satisfied.

* Powered by the advanced Unison, Syncany and other file backup algorithms, it can easily backup your iPhone contents (music, video, pictures, iTunes encrypted purchases, iBooks, ringtones...) to macOS and Windows, smooth as butter.
* Maximize the flexibility to let you freely select what you want to backup, the entire files or selective files.

## 5\. MacX vs iTunes: File Management

More often than not, we entitle iTunes as an iPhone manager than an iPhone backup tool partly because its commercial slogan is "iTunes is the easiest way to organize and enjoy the music, movies, TV shows, apps, and books you already have. Yet, we can't sugarcoat the truth that iTunes leaves too much to be desired. The headachy iTunes errors during iPhone file management never comes to an end...

* Music genres are wrong in iTunes Match on iOS.
* iPhone song shows different artist than in iTunes.
* iTunes won't let me edit song info and I can't delete music from iOS device in iTunes.
* I cannot delete photos from "Synced from iTunes Library".
* iTunes is messing up music and playlist. It costs me much time to organize music into playlist and adjust the settings to prevent my iPhone from automatically syncing with iTunes lest some of songs randomly get missing.

## 6\. iTunes vs MacX MediaTrans: Charges

Not a single iTunes user complained about Apple charges within iTunes. They often receive an alert that their cards are charged over 29.99/60 dollars to iTunes for no purchase or fault of theirs. The moment they get such messages, they contact Apple support and are told, "We are sorry that was done in error and we will refund this within 10 days.". Yes, they do refund your money, but it causes some overdraft fees for your credit card 10 days later.

What's more, you have no need to bear the consequences of TV shows rejection caused by iTunes payment failure error.
