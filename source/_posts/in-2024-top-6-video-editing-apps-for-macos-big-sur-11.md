Released in November 2020, **macOS Big Sur** is the latest OS version for Mac systems. The operating system is equipped with tons of features and has an optimized algorithm for running apps. Sadly, a lot of existing apps are no longer compatible with it and users often find it hard to pick a decent video editor Big Sur app. Don’t worry, in this post, I will make you familiar with the 6 best video editing apps for macOS Big Sur that you can consider trying.

## Top 1\. Wondershare Filmora

Considered one of the best video editing apps, Filmora is 100% compatible with macOS Big Sur. The tool has some of the most advanced editing options and features a user-friendly interface with no learning curve.

* There are hundreds of transitions, overlays, filters, captions, etc. that you can add to your videos and further customize.
* You can work on keyframing in Filmora to make minor edits in your videos easily.
* There is a dedicated audio mixer with an advanced audio ducking option. You can also add voiceovers to videos directly on Filmora.

## Top 2\. Apple iMovie

If you don’t want to use any third-party macOS Big Sur app, then you can simply try iMovie. With the new macOS Bir Sur update, you can also enjoy a revamped version of iMovie that can meet all the basic video editing needs.

* You can import all kinds of media from your Mac to iMovie to create or edit videos.

* Only offers a 7-day free trial.

## Top 6\. Blender

Lastly, if you are looking for a free open-source 3D animation and video editor Big Sur app, then Blender should be your first pick. Even though this macOS Big Sur app is available for free, it has several professional editing options that you would love to explore.

Now when you know 6 different macOS Big Sur compatible video editors, you can easily pick a preferred app. I would recommend **Wondershare Filmora** as the best macOS Big Sur video editor since it is equipped with tons of editing features. Not just that, the application is extremely easy to learn and has hundreds of templates, transitions, filters, etc. that would save your time in editing for sure.
