## Part 1\. What is KineMaster App?

KineMaster is probably the best video editing software for mobile devices having unique features like Chroma key, video transitions, audio/video effects, and many more, which would help you to turn your imaginations into reality.

**Download:** you can download the app from [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster/id1223932558).

**Price:** One of the best advantages of KineMaster is that it is available in free and paid versions for its users, but the question arises here. What is the difference between them? Let us tell you if you are using its free version. There are a few restrictions like you cannot access highly advanced editing tools, popular filters, effects, stickers, etc. The biggest con among them is they will put their watermark on your videos, which may affect their looks. But if you are using their paid version, you have unlimited access to everything, and there will also be no watermark on your exported videos. Also, in its free version, you may face some ads, which will not be if you use its paid version. However, you can download its cracked version from [RevDl](https://www.revdl.com/kinemaster-pro-mod-apk-download9.html/) to get unlimited access to everything without ads.

### **Disadvantages:**

## Part 6\. The best KineMaster App Alternative on Desktop

Although you can also use the KineMaster app on a desktop by following the instructions above, it can still not compete with any desktop video editor as they have much more powerful and advanced editing tools. So, it's better to use any of its alternatives on the desktop instead of using it.

So, the question now is: Which of its desktop alternatives is the best? It's called [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well. Including motion tracking, keyframing, speed ramping, auto beat sync, Boris FX, NewBlue FX, and many more. Also, its export quality is highly better than KineMaster's as well.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

## Conclusion

So, in the end, today's article concludes that KineMaster is undoubtedly one of the best video editing apps available for mobile devices. But if we come to the desktop, it does not look good enough to compete with any desktop editing software as it is made especially for mobile devices. So if you are a desktop user, you should use any of its alternative on a desktop like Wondershare Filmora, which have all the advanced and professional features you want to have in your desktop video editor.
