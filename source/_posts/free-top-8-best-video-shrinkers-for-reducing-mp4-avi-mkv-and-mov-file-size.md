## Part 1: macXvideo - Reduce Videos to 90% Smaller with No Quality Loss!

A 100% free video compressing tool is recommended - [**macXvideo**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) (or [Windows Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)). Its advanced compression engine can shrink a video size by 90% smaller. Plus, it also ensures the fastest speed and excellent quality thanks to built-in High Quality Engine, multi-core CPU, advanced hyper-threading and hardware acceleration tech. 

See, it can compress MP4, MKV, MOV, AVI, AVCHD, 4K, 8K, to FLV, WMV, 1080P, 720P, etc. much smaller-sized file fomats or resolution (180+ video & 14+ audio output formats) and stunning parameter settings adjustment (Bit rate, frame rate, resolution, etc.). The video editing features further shrink the video size: crop video bars or unwanted black parts; trim video to cut off the needless video clips to get the desired video length, add or extract subtitles from video, etc. All these tasks will be achieved in mins or even secs, Intel QSV/AMD/Nvidia hardware acceleration improves the speed up to 5X faster than any other compressors.

### How to Compress Video Fast Without Losing Quality 

**Step 1**: [Free download](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) the video compressing software [Mac version](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Run it and hit "Add File" to load the video file you wanna shrink. 

**Step 2**: Select the output format. For example, if you want to [compress MP4 file size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), you can select smaller-sized FLV or WMV as output. Based our test, the free video compressor shrinked a 490MB 4K MP4 file size to 28MB HD FLV video in 1 minute and the output video was great. 

**Tips**: You can adjust video settings like resolution and bit rate to downsize the video file. It is recommended to decrease the default bit rate by 20-50%. Video demensions also influence file size greatly. For example, 3840x 2160 (4K) will have more horizontal lines than 1080P, and therefore large space to store the extra information. For regular users, 720P and 1080P are good enough. Please note that uncompressed audio will make a difference in video size. If you're not a devoted audiophile, adjust the audio bit rate if necessary.
