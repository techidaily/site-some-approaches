## 1\. Fast Speed

 MacX Video Converter Pro is the first Mac HD video converting tool that offers support for the three major hardware acceleration tech - Intel QSV, Nvidia Cuda/Nvenc, AMD in the whole conversion. That is to say, from HD video decoding, processing to encoding, the whole process will be carried by the GPU not CPU. GPU is dedictaed to processing graphic intensive tasks, therefore it's faster than CPU. The 3-Level Hardware, as the developer named, delivers **World's Fastest speed**, up to 5X faster speed compared with other competitors. It's worth mentioning that Digiarty has optimized the hardware acceleration for UHD 4k and HD format HEVC H.265\. 

![HD video Converter for Mac in quality & speed](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/hw-brands.jpg)

Comparatively speaking, there are many programs on the market that offer support for GPU acceleration too, like Handbrake. But they support only one acceleration tech, like Intel or Nvidia, or they take advantage of GPU in a single stage only. Without the advanced hardware acceleration tech, the HD video conversion mainly relies on your Mac computer's hardware configuration (more powerful graphics processing unit, multi-core CPU, internal memory, hard drive, etc.) to accelerate the HD video conversion speed. That's why the computer heats up easily when converting a HD video. 

For example, when converting a 4K 60FPS mp4 video, Handbrake takes 14 minutes while MacX Video Converter Pro uses 2 minutes only.

## 2\. Excellent Quality

It's pain if the fast speed comes at the cost of video quality. As crisp picture quality is the basic feature of HD 1080P/720P videos, any video processing software for Mac is essentailly useless if it can't produce users with a High Quality ouput video.
