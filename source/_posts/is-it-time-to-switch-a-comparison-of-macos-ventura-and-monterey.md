The pubilc key will be stored oon teh server, while the private one won't. This could help users avoid the issues of password leaks from data breaches or phishing scams that steal access to your account. The private key can be authorized through Touch ID or Face ID, after then , users get an access to visit websites and applications.

### 2\. Don't Install MacOS 13 Ventura Beta Version

Though MacOS 13 Ventura beta version is avaiable, it's not a good idea to install the beta versions. In general, one of the biggest reason for not installing any beta software is the lack of stability. And there are security risks for MacOS Ventura beta versions. Still, given the large number of new features in MacOS Ventura, third-party app developers have yet to optimize their apps to run smoothly on the latest version of MacOS. Moreover, MacOS 13 Ventura beta version may not have all the features, since Apple sometimes reserves features for later versions of the macOS.
