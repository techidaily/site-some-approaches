Still, there are some improvents for Safari on MacOS Ventura, making it the fastest browser. Safari is now able to render and process the most usage-intensive websites with impressive speed and power efficiency.

MacOS Ventura has introduced a new feature called Passkeys, which is an end-to-end encrypted method to log in websites without any passwords. The way Passkey works is creating two unique keys, namely a public key and a private key, which will work only for teh specific site or application while creating an account. The pubilc key will be stored oon teh server, while the private one won't. This could help users avoid the issues of password leaks from data breaches or phishing scams that steal access to your account. The private key can be authorized through Touch ID or Face ID, after then , users get an access to visit websites and applications.

### 5\. Continuity Camera

The Continuity Camera in MacOS Monterey is limited to scanning documents and taking pictures on your iPhone camera and sending them instantaneously to your Mac. While in MacOS Vertura, Continuity Camera will be imporved all-round. It allows you to use your iPhone's back cameras as your webcam. In other words, you could use your high-quality iPhone camera instead of the normal webcam on your Mac to capture your face during calls, meetings, and filming videos. Moverover, the center stage feature will always keep you in the center of the frame even if you move to the edge of the frame. 

As what we mentioned above, Continuty Camera in Ventura works perfect with the Universal Control feature, which offers a desk view option. It utilizes the image being presented from the bottom view of your iPhone's camera and stretches the image to mimic an overhead camera which ends up presenting an accurate image of your desk view.

### 2\. Don't Install MacOS 13 Ventura Beta Version

Though MacOS 13 Ventura beta version is avaiable, it's not a good idea to install the beta versions. In general, one of the biggest reason for not installing any beta software is the lack of stability. And there are security risks for MacOS Ventura beta versions. Still, given the large number of new features in MacOS Ventura, third-party app developers have yet to optimize their apps to run smoothly on the latest version of MacOS. Moreover, MacOS 13 Ventura beta version may not have all the features, since Apple sometimes reserves features for later versions of the macOS.
