HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) featuring better quality and much smaller file size has soared in popularity. However, there are times when you have to decode HEVC to MP4 H.264/MPEG4 or other popular formats since many mobile devices, video editors and media players don't support [HEVC codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). There are many reported errors during H.265 playback, for example, _"I tried the latest version of VLC, MPC, Potplayer to no avail. My players can smoothly play 1080p videos but sadly not the 1080p HEVC files. Is there any free HEVC decoder available?"_  Unluckily, it's not easy to decode HEVC video files.

Free download the fastest HEVC decoder to transcode HEVC/H.265 to H.264 or MP4, whether you are going to play HEVC on VLC Media Player, QuickTime Player, iPhone iPad, Android Windows mobile phones and tables, TVs, or edit it in Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or for other uses.

## HEVC Hardware Decoder vs HEVC Software Decoder 

Currently, there are two ways to ensure smoothly HEVC playback - HEVC software decoder and hardware decoder. The former is flexible and supports a wide range of media formats. Any computer can decode H.265 with the aid of H.265 codec decoding software. But decoding HEVC using software consumes more CPU power. 

Compared with average HEVC converting software, it's more efficient to built a HEVC hardware decoder into chips to decode H.265 video, especially the large 4K UHD file. The whole decoding process becomes much smoother and lower CPU usage is a big advantage from HEVC hardware decoder. Here are some world-famous hardware that supports efficient HEVC playback due to the support of HEVC decoding blocks: 

* Apple iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac supporting iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra.
* Google Chromecast Ultra
* Microsoft Xbox One
* Intel 6th-generation 'Skylake' or newer
* Nvidia GeForce GTX 960/950 or newer
* 4th Generation Intel Core processors (Haswell CPU 2- 3.5GHz, 4 Cores) or newer
* GoPro Hero6 Black action camera with 4K60p HEVC video encoding.

However, some graphic cards (AMD) have issues with 4K HEVC codec decoding, like messed images, broken outputs, etc. And if it's not working on HEVC hardware decoding, you have to turn to the HEVC decoding software for help. The most popular HEVC/H.265 decoding freeware includes [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) and FFmpeg.

## Common Problems with Free HEVC/H.265 Decoder 

 Compared to H.264, HEVC is much more difficult to decode due to its complexity. This is because HEVC decoding has much higher demand on computer power and the process imposes huge load on CPU. So when you rely on common freeware to decode HEVC/H.265 files, it may have errors as follows:  
1\. Programs might chock on decoding 4K UHD HEVC videos or crash quite often, and the CPU usage spikes to 100%.  
2\. The loading time can be lengthy and the output video quality can be in a mess.  
3\. Even the most popular freeware [HEVC decoder Handbrake](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is facing problems when processing 4K HEVC/H.265 decoding - it's very slow, only about 4 frames/sec though quick sync is enabled (4K UHD HEVC video decoding speed varies between computers).  
4\. Some HEVC hardware decoders manage to transcode the HEVC video but the outputs are choppy and unwatchable on VLC.

## Here's the fastest 4K UHD HEVC/H.265 decoder software with low CPU usage

Free HEVC decoder Handbrake isn't the best option considering its slow and relatively disappointing performance. So what's the best HEVC/[H.265 converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) & decoder that can make the whole process more efficient? [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) was and still is the best bet.

* Fast speed - It's the fastest H.265/HEVC processing tool that can load 4K UHD HEVC files in seconds and decode HEVC/H.265 at 5x faster speed than Handbrake, thanks to its hardware acceleration tech. No worries about chocking or crashing.
* Low CPU usage - The improved decoding algorithm for HEVC codec helps the software give the biggest performance boost yet with the lowest CPU usage. The HEVC/H.265 decoding won't affect other apps running on the same host.
* Decode HEVC to any format - It fully supports decoding 4K UHD [H.265 to H.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), MPEG4, MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, etc for better compatibility with your players, mobile devices, TVs, gaming systems, etc without any stuttering.
* HEVC encoder - It works as an [HEVC encoder](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that enables you to transcode videos of H.264, VP9, MPEG4, MKV, etc. to HEVC/H.265 without any hassle.
* High quality - Its embedded High Quality Engine guarantees nearly no quality loss during decoding.
* Support both Mac and Windows - It is available for Windows and Mac, with the latest Windows 10 and macOS Sierra supported.
