### 1\. MacX DVD Ripper Free

**Supported OS:** Windows (11/10/8/7), Mac (macOS 10.6 and later)

**Features:**

MacX DVD Ripper Free offers a range of features that make it a useful tool for DVD copy, ripping and conversion. Some of the features include:

One of the drawbacks of MacX DVD Ripper Free is that it is only available for Mac users. However, the software is compatible with the latest macOS version, including macOS Ventura.

**How to copy DVD with MacX DVD Ripper Free**

**Step 1**. Download and install MacX DVD Ripper Free on your Mac.

**Step 5** . Hit "RUN" button to start the ripping process. The software will begin to copy the DVD content onto your computer in the selected output format.

### 2\. Disk Utility

**Supported OS:** Mac

Disk Utility is a built-in tool on macOS that offers a range of disk-related functions. While Disk Utility is not a dedicated DVD copy software, it can be used to create disk images of DVDs, which essentially creates a copy of the DVD. This disk image is essentially a virtual copy of the DVD that is stored on the Mac's hard drive. Once the disk image is created, users can access it just like a physical DVD. They can watch movies, view files, and perform any other action that they would with a regular DVD. Since it is already included on Macs, it's a convenient option for Mac users.

**Features:**

* Disk Utility can create disk images of CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. This can be done by selecting the "New Image" option in the File menu, choosing the disc to be copied, selecting the desired output format, and choosing a save location.
* Disk Utility can also burn disk images to CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. This can be done by selecting the "Burn" option in the File menu, choosing the disk image to be burned, selecting the desired burning speed and number of copies, and clicking "Burn".
* Disk Utility can erase rewritable CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs, allowing them to be used again.
* Disk Utility can also partition disks, dividing them into multiple volumes with separate file systems.

**Drawback:**

However, there are also some limitations to using Disk Utility as a DVD copy software. 

Firstly, it can only create a disk image of a DVD, so users cannot make a physical copy of the DVD onto a blank disc. 

Additionally, it does not have the ability to bypass copy protection on DVDs, so it cannot copy DVDs that have been protected with digital rights management (DRM) or other encryption methods.

### 3\. DVD Shrink 

**Supported OS:** Windows

DVD Shrink is a free DVD copy and compression software for Windows that has been around for many years. It's designed to help users create backup copies of their DVDs and also reduce the size of DVD content so that it can fit on a single-layer DVD disc. 

**Features:**

* Copy CSS-protected DVDs: DVD Shrink features a DeCSS decryption algorithm, enabling it to handle DVDs protected by Content Scramble System (CSS).
* Advanced compression settings: DVD Shrink allows users to choose the amount of compression they want to apply to their DVD content. This is particularly useful when trying to fit large DVD content onto a single-layer DVD disc. This DVD copy software also offers a "Deep Analysis" option that analyzes the DVD content and adjusts the compression settings accordingly to maintain the quality of the output.
* Output formats: DVD Shrink allows exporting ISO image files and DVD folders.

DVD Shrink has a simple and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. DVD Shrink's performance is generally considered to be fast and efficient, especially when compared to other DVD compression and backup software at the time of its release. Its compressed domain video processing technology allowed for faster transcoding and better performance, as only part of the video stream is decoded and scraped. However, this DVD copy program's speed and efficiency can vary depending on the size and complexity of the DVD being compressed, as well as the user's computer hardware and settings.

**Drawback:**

DVD Shrink hasn't been updated for several years, which means this DVD copier may not work well with new operating systems and newer DVDs. Users may encounter issues when trying to backup certain DVDs. The backward DVD decryption tech cannot support you to cope with the more and more complicated DVD DRM encryption tech. So you may need to find a [DVD Shrink alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to handle newly released titles.

One additional limitation of DVD Shrink is that it has a restricted export function, as it can only export VIDEO\_TS and ISO files. Exporting to VIDEO\_TS and ISO files is great if you're planning to burn your compressed movie onto a DVD disc. But if you want to play the compressed movie on a device that doesn't support VIDEO\_TS or ISO files, you will need to convert the exported file to a different format.

### 4\. Handbrake

Handbrake is a popular free open-source video transcoder software that also doubles as a DVD copy software. The software is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to a wide range of users. HandBrake works with popular video formats including MP4, MKV, and WebM. It can also work with a wide range of codecs, including x264, x265, and VP9, among others. This makes it possible to copy DVDs to a wide range of devices and platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and game consoles.

* Handbrake offers premade presets for various devices, such as Apple TV, iPhone, and Android, so users can quickly and easily optimize their videos for their preferred device.
* In addition to the premade presets, Handbrake allows users to create custom presets with advanced settings. This gives users complete control over the encoding process and allows them to fine-tune the video output to their specific needs. Handbrake's advanced settings include options for adjusting the video codec, bitrate, resolution, and more.
* Finally, Handbrake supports hardware acceleration. This is especially useful for users who frequently convert large video files or copy DVDs and Blu-rays.

**Drawback:**

Handbrake is a popular and powerful DVD copy software that offers a variety of useful features for users. However, there are a few downsides to this program that are worth noting.

 One of the main disadvantages is that it does not include decryption features, so users will need to use another program to remove any copy protection on their DVDs. People usually install libdvdcss to work with HandBrake. However, this solution can be troublesome for Mac users running El Capitan or later versions of macOS. Moreover, this solution may not work with newer DVDs that employ more advanced copy protection schemes.

 Additionally, it does not support copying DVDs to ISO files or folder structures, which may be a deal-breaker for some users.

In addition to its decryption and output limitations, Handbrake has a few other downsides. For instance, the user interface can be a bit daunting for beginners, and there is a learning curve to understanding all of the program's settings and options. Moreover, the program can be slow when encoding videos, particularly on older or less powerful hardware.

* Freemake Video Converter allows users to burn videos to DVD and Blu-ray discs. The software supports a range of video formats and users can customize their DVD menus and subtitles.
* Freemake Video Converter offers basic video editing features such as trimming, cropping, adding subtitles, and watermarking. Users can also adjust the video brightness, contrast, and saturation.
* Download Videos: Freemake Video Converter has a built-in downloader that can download videos from popular video sharing sites.

**Drawback:**

There are some drawbacks to using Freemake Video Converter as a DVD copy software. One of the main limitations is that it can only copy non-encrypted DVDs. This means that users will need to use a separate program to decrypt any copy-protected DVDs before using Freemake Video Converter to copy them.

Additionally, the company tries very hard to persuade users to pay for its premium version. The free version comes with certain limitations such as watermarked videos, limited video conversion options, and slower processing speeds. Freemake encourages users to upgrade to the premium version to remove these limitations and gain access to additional features. The company uses various tactics to encourage users to pay, such as offering pop-up windows and reminders to upgrade, promoting premium features prominently on the user interface, and limiting the functionality of the free version.
