## Class-Action Lawsuit Claims T-Mobile's Promised Price Match Policy Is Deceptive

After a spate of controversial price increases, T-Mobile is now facing a class action lawsuit. Plaintiffs allege that they were deceived by T-Mobile's highly publicized lifetime price guarantee, which contained major loopholes that were not made obvious to potential customers or active subscribers.

 The plaintiffs, who filed their [complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.551616/gov.uscourts.njd.551616.1.0.pdf) to the U.S. District Court on July 12th, claim that the price of their T-Mobile subscriptions increased "without their consent and in violation of the promises made by T-Mobile." They hope to represent all U.S. residents who were impacted by a price increase after receiving a price guarantee from T-Mobile, and they seek to obtain "restitution of all amounts obtained by Defendant as a result of its violation" in addition to damages and an injunction against T-Mobile's "unfair conduct."

 T-Mobile's original lifetime price guarantee was established in 2017 as a pillar of the "Un-Carrier" marketing campaign. T-Mobile [boasted](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next) that "customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it." This policy was rarely (if ever) the focus of TV advertisements, though it was frequently used as a sales pitch by T-Mobile personnel and became a popular talking point in [media coverage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/01/12/why-t-mobiles-all-in-pricing-strategy-could-pay-off/). T-Mobile's former CEO, John Legere, also cited the price guarantee when publicly [antagonizing](https://fortune.com/2017/01/06/t-mobile-ceo-2017-predictions/) rival carriers like AT&T and Verizon.

 That said, the promise that "T-Mobile will never change the price you pay" contained some underlying clauses. An FAQ on T-Mobile's website clarified that T-Mobile _could_ raise prices at any time. The so-called "price guarantee" simply promised a full refund on your final month of service if you chose to cancel after a price hike.

 Here's the confusing part of this story; an adjusted Price Lock system, which was introduced in 2022, genuinely protected T-Mobile customers from price hikes. Customers who joined T-Mobile between April 2022 and January 2024 have not experienced any changes in pricing. New subscribers still receive a "Price Lock," but it's really just a [rehash of the 2017 price guarantee](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-targeted-approach-carving-out-your-space-on-youtube/)—you can get a refund if you cancel after a price hike, and all that.

 We're in an odd situation where _some_ T-Mobile customers experience price increases while others do not. Seven years of wishy-washy policy, strange corporate loopholes, and [questionable underhanded actions](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-up-your-game-expert-tips-on-producing-compelling-slow-motion-photos-and-videos-for-instagram/) now provide fodder for the class action lawsuit that T-Mobile is forced to fight against.

 T-Mobile may argue that the terms of its price guarantees, including the aforementioned caveats, have always been available online. Plaintiffs acknowledge this fact, but they say that T-Mobile's terms were not included in paperwork or other documents at signup. This lawsuit could easily veer into a discussion of [dark patterns](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/ftc-study-finds-dark-patterns-used-by-a-majority-of-subscription-apps-and-websites/)—deceptive corporate practices that increasingly draw the ire of the FTC.

 Class action lawsuits can take months or years to reach a conclusion. This one's just gearing up. We'll provide updates once T-Mobile comments on the situation.
