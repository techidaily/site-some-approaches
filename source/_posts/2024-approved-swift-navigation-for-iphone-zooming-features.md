iPhone users or any other device, capturing every essence of life and watching them closely can rejuvenate your routined dull life. Often a video gives access to small happiness that you left behind with time. Don’t you think it would be a great idea if you could zoom videos on every device? Zoom video on iPhone feature is a great one that enables you to watch the faces and expressions and capture closely, which is truly a visual treat.

## Part1: Why You Need to Zoom in/out

For a long time, only the photo could be zoomed in/out on iPhone. If users wanted to record a zoom video on iPhone that was not possible. But, with the coming of iPhone 7 Plus, users can zoom in/out while recording. If you want to record something that is far from you, zoom in can give you a clearer vision of the object and also let you watch using the zoom for iPhone later, which makes it highly desirable.

#### 2. [Video Zoom](https://itunes.apple.com/al/app/video-zoom/id949836723?mt=8)

Are your videos looking dull and vague to understand the essence of the clip? Did you forget to use the zoom for iPhone feature while capturing? If you forgot to zoom in when recording, use Video Zoom! to play your recording. Video zoom is a video extension that can help you in adding effects like pan, crop, or zoom video on iPhone to enhance it. You can zoom even when your video is paused. The photo extension support help in quickly launching the video zoom app from the system photos. You may save the edited photos as a copy to refer to it at a later date from the app gallery. The edited video output can be selected equal to original or lower.

## Conclusion

With the advent of a number of unique apps like Filmora, the zoom video on iPhone can be enjoyed by all the iOS users. You can easily add clarity to the video by adding zoom in effects that can be created using Filmora and other similar apps. The zoom for iPhone feature can even help you see the real colors of the butterfly sitting on a flower quite far from you, which I feel is a complete treat to the eyes. Nature comes closer to you through the lenses of your iPhone camera. Enjoy the feature and if you cannot, then don’t lose your heart, try Filmora.
