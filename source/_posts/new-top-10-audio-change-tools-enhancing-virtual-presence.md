Locate the **VoiceMeeter Aux Input**, right-click on it and pick **Set as Default Device** from the options that appear underneath.

Virtual Audio Input 2: This is where windows send all of your communication traffic from social media platforms.

Virtual Audio Input 3: This is where windows will send signals from music apps like Spotify, etc.

Rename **Virtual Audio Input 1**, **2** & **3** as **PC Audio**, **Communication**, and **Music** respectively.

Step6 Once the above setup is complete, move to the **Hardware Outputs** section and configure it. There are 8 hardware output panels. You need to edit each one of them. Here is an image of what the output panels look like:
