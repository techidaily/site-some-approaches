Additionally, it is best to use competitive but highly searched keywords. Since YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine's ranking formulas are largely the same.

Use the aforementioned YouTube title generating tool if you are running out of ideas.

When someone clicks on your video, it tells Google and YouTube that it's a video that people are interested in watching.
