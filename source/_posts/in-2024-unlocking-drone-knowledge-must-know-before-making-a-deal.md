If you are planning to develop your own drone then check guidelines for Do It Yourself procedures.

## Drone/Quadcopter Buying Tips

 Here we are going to talk about some of the best drone buying tips:

#### 1\.  Budget

 One of the major factor playing roles behind your drone selection is your planned budget. You can prefer to go for higher end collections or being a beginner can pick the basic one. Note that, most of people find difficulties to fly a cheap drone collection but expensive drones show impressive results in flight due to their advanced sensor units and powerful propellers. Before placing order for your drone, prefer to check offers from different companies like Amazon, Hobby King Etc. and compare their discounts. Few websites also provide discounts when you buy drones with additional accessories so you can plan your purchase accordingly. The low budget investment will lead to a drone that has small battery life with limited features whereas the expensive units can serve you with amazing results in every flight.

#### 2\.  Flight Time

 This parameter is used to decide the average flying time of your drone with single charge. It is good to plan for a powerful battery backup if you need to use your drone for photography purpose. Few drones come with rechargeable batteries whereas others also offer replacement options so that users can use spare batteries for emergency hours. Most of these drones take almost 45 to 90 minutes to full charge and the minimum flight time is observed to be 10 to 12 minutes. Note that if you keep on doing tricks and flips with your drone then it will definitely lead to faster decay in power and flight time will automatically get reduced. Size of battery, load carrying capacity and several other factors can affect flight times of a drone.

#### 3\.  Camera

 Many quadcopters are designed with abilities to carry a camera unit with them so that they can shoot scenes from different angles in the air. Even various action cameras also possess specially designed drone mounts so that they can fulfill the needs of high quality recording. This impressive attachment to drone is really a great idea but one need to use high resolution camera units for this purpose and preferably it should be share free. Some drones are sold with pre-mounted camera units whereas others may come with dedicated mounts. The GPS enabled drones can assist users to capture stills or videos with active location information.

#### 4. Controller

 Every drone possesses a controller inside it and this works like brain of the whole system. Controller is sometimes also known as transmitter that assists in transferring input commands to the copter during flight. Drone controllers commonly operate at 2.4 GHz frequency range. This frequency range is standard for all drone designs that are used for commercial as well as entertainment related applications. Buyers are advised to check features and specifications of drones before placing order because there is a wide range of capabilities that you can access with different designs. Few units are designed with buttons on their body whereas others may have LCD screen for managing controls. The controller works like a central unit in every case.

#### 5\.  Sensor

 Cheap drones do not have sensors or may have very few embedded on them but if you buy an expensive unit then it will accommodate so many advanced sensors on board. Some of the most popularly used sensor types are GPS and temperature sensors. The GPS enabled units are able to move via specific locations as fixed in their programming controls. It is possible to adjust the longitude and latitude values of device so that it can travel in a preset direction only. One advanced quadcopter named as DJI Phantom is having return home feature that makes it able to come back to actual location when users presses the home button.

#### 6\.  Educate Yourself

 Before you decide to invest on any drone it is good to gather information about all so that you can rate them as per your need. Many buyers spend huge money on wrong drones just because of lack of information about their functionality and capabilities. Buying a drone is a costly affair so it is good to educate yourself first and then pick right device after making huge analysis. Make a set of features that you are expected from your drone and plan your budget carefully. If you need some additional accessories to operate your drone for specific applications then they must be included in the budget list. You can easily find various tutorials in form of videos over internet that can provide huge information about how to use a drone.

#### 7\.  Respect the Law

 You might be aware about the fact that every country follows some specific set of rules of drone flights and they must be followed strictly. The flight heights, timing and locations- everything should be well planned to avoid air accidents. Rule violation can cause damage on large scale so buyers are advised to stay updated about government guidelines.
