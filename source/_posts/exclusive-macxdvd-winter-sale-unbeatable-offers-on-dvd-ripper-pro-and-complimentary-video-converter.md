### Sound from Worldwide **See what our customers say about MacX DVD Ripper Pro**

“MacX DVD Ripper Pro is a solid, intuitive application that is great for ripping and converting my Disney kids DVD movies. It has some good customization options for removing menus, bonus features like movie editing, external subtitles adding.” _By Harry Athea_

“I love it because it's a great starting point to getting my movie collection digitalized. It has tackled every disc I have thrown at it all at astounding speeds (rips typically take about 30-45 minutes) and the videos are crisp! No chopping of video or audio.” _By Mogens Miner_

“One of the fastest I've found out there and absolutely no problems copying any DVDs. I personally use to copy my old DVDs (before they had digital copies) on my hard drive in a MP4 format (1.5 GBs) that is compatible with iTunes and can be synced with any apple product. ” _By Lisa Schmeidler_
