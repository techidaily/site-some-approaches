### Method 1: Open SRT files on Mac using TextEdit

It is possible to use NotePad for viewing the **SRT Mac-based** files if they are planning to open the basic text-based SRT files. However, the alternative for Mac is called TextEdit, and it works similarly as the NotePad word-processing program.

**Features:**

* Simple user interface.
* Easy to create new SRT files.
* No major length-based limitations.
* Lightweight solution.

 Pros

* Easily accessible on the device.

## Part 3: The Best Way to Edit .SRT Files for Videos on Mac

Instead, you can opt for an efficient video editing software like Filmora if you are wondering **how to create SRT file on Mac** and then edit it. The software supports SRT files for viewing, formatting, editing, and more.

**What is Filmora?**

The software comes with various standard-level and advanced editing functions, including speech-to-text for voiceover-based transcriptions into the video. Moreover, you can use the preset effects, including Boris FX/NewBlue FX (on certain Mac devices only), to further optimize video quality. Not only the video, but you can also edit the audio playback, voiceovers, and edit SRT files here.
