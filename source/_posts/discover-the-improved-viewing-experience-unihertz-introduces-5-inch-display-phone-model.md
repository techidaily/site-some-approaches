## Discover the Improved Viewing Experience: Unihertz Introduces 5-Inch Display Phone Model

If you want to buy a phone that you can use one-handed, your options have dwindled in the last few years. For screens smaller than 6 inches, you're basically just down to the iPhone SE by this point, and the regular iPhone 15 is also fairly compact compared to other offerings. Now, Unihertz wants to launch a phone in a form factor we haven't seen in a really long time.

 Unihertz, which is a brand you probably know for its hilarious tiny or [otherwise unique phones](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/who-saw-my-google-doc-uncover-viewers-with-ease/), has just released a phone that is still tiny, but a size that's probably way more appealing for a lot of people: the Unihertz Jelly Max. The smartphone packs a 5-inch display, which is a form factor that we haven't seen in a really long time. It has tiny bezels, so it's probably closer to the size of those 4-inch/4.5-inch phones from the early 2010s in actual size. And of course, it's a phone that's easily pocketable and easy to carry around. We've gotten used to our big phones (we used to call them phablets), but this is how phones used to come out at one point.

 Hardware-wise, the Jelly Max features a 1520x720 display, a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor, 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 4,000 mAh battery with 66W fast charging, a 100MP primary camera, an 8MP telephoto camera, a 32MP front camera, and a fingerprint sensor. It supports 5G, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and FM radio. The phone will arrive with Android 14, but don't expect to see much, if any, software updates if you do end up getting it.

 Additional features include an infrared remote and a customizable Jelly Max button. The 720p display might put some people off, but then again, it's a really small display, so in terms of pixel density, it's probably not that bad.

 The phone is expected to be available for $339 once crowdfunding ends, which is a decent price for a mid-range/budget phone. You can [get it on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/jelly-max-the-smallest-5g-smartphone/) now. Crowdfunded tech devices are usually sketchy, but Unihertz has successfully launched multiple phones through Kickstarter, so we're not expecting the company to suddenly fall apart.
