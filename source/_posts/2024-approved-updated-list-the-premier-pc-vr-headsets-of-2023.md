### [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com)

[HTC Vive](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) wins the war of best VR headsets launched till now. It gives a most complete virtual reality experience to its customers. Vive also includes two motion controllers along with a headset and also two base stations. It allows the user of Vive much better immersive experience than an outmoded controller. Because it is the best product in the market for VR experience it is also very expensive.

### [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/)

Comparing to HTC Vive having its room-scale technology along with two of the included motion controllers [Oculus Rift](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) still considered to be the matching VR experience. Traditional game controllers are very much limited to a static virtual reality experience as compared to the Rift. Proper hand tracking is required to enjoy the immerse feel of the Rift.

### [Microsoft HoloLens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This device merges augmented and virtual reality and in turn considered as one of the most ruthless development ever planned by the developers. It blends real world elements with the augmented holographic metaphors, so that you can walk on other planets while walking in your living room. Handset is also provided with a full window 10 system inside it. It is now available for the windows insider affiliates.

### [Razer OSVR HDK 2](https://www.razerzone.com/hdk2-promo)

### [FOVE VR](https://www.getfove.com/)

FOVE VR is a different type of technology because it provides cooperating eye-tracking. There is an infrared sensor built in the headset which tracks the eye movement of the user hence offering a new method of controlling it and giving this design an edge over other headsets. Because of this technology it makes the virtual reality to be more real.

### [META 2](https://www.metavision.com/)

Meta was released in 2013 for augmented reality but now Meta 2 is the real invention that has caught eyes on. It looks like a replica of HoloLens, a largely shaped design like a helmet. But this VR headset provides the greater field of view in comparison to other headsets. Due to its versatility, it is not cheap like many other VR headsets available in the market.

### Sulon Q VR Headset

This device was released in San Francisco during GDC 2016\. It is considered to be a competitor of HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. It is compatible with the PC on windows 10\. Unlike some of the other headsets it does not require high-end computer to work with. In addition to virtual reality it also provides its users to enjoy the augmented reality experiences. It is a very pricey product.

### [Avegant Glyph](https://www.avegant.com/)

The design of Glyph is very interesting and beautiful. With audio centric design, it can be worn like headphones. The vision is in front of your eyes. Each eye catches 1280 x 720 display. Avegant gives a more immersive display than virtual reality display. So, it could be used in drones or watching movies as you want.

### [Sony Morpheus](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/)

The best companies for technology in the world always try to take the lead from one another to provide their customers the best. Sony also designed its VR headset named as Sony Morpheus. Morpheus provides 960 by 1080 resolution for each eye. It hasn’t been publicized commercially yet but it was out in march 2015\. Sony is also taking lead in virtual reality trend.

### [VISUS](https://www.visus.com/)

It is no doubt very interesting experience at a very low price.
