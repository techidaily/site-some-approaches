### How to Use Voicemeeter to Modify your Voice

Follow the detailed instructions below to edit your Vtube voice using Voicemeeter:

Locate the **Start** icon at the bottom left corner of your screen and click on it.

![start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-000.png)

Select **Settings** from the options that comes up, and the interface below will come up:

![settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-001.png)

Click on the **Playback** panel, and scroll to where you have VoiceMeeter Input. Right-click on **VoiceMeeter Input** and a couple of options will come up. Select **Set as Default Device** to proceed.

![set as default device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-002.png)

Virtual Audio Input 2: This is where windows send all of your communication traffic from social media platforms.
