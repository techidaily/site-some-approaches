If you want to add some spice to your content, it's essential to be able to find free images online.

You don't need a subscription to a stock photo site or money on hand; there are plenty of places with high-quality photos you can use for free. All you have to do is search for them!

Pixabay is one of the most popular websites for free images. It has a wide range of photos from different photographers and categories, so it's easy to find an image that could fit your needs.

## 5\. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/)

![snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-sites-to-get-free-images-05.JPG)

Snappa is one of my favorite sites for free images because it's easy to navigate, has a wide selection of photos and graphics, and doesn't require attribution or watermarks.

The site has an extensive library of free stock photos, vectors, mockups, and templates categorized by industry (e.g., technology), scene (e.g., cityscapes), and more.

It can be a little hard to find exactly what you're looking for as there are so many options; if you have trouble finding what you want in Snappa's search engine, try clicking on one of the categories listed above to narrow it down some more.

## 6\. [Freerange](https://freerangestock.com/)

One of the best places to get free images is Shutterstock. They have a collection of over 70,000 royalty-free images that are available for commercial use, and they don't watermark their photos.

## 10\. CC Search

![cc search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-sites-to-get-free-images-10.JPG)

CC Search is a search engine for Creative Commons photos, which means you can use the images on your website without paying anything. CC Search has an extensive collection of images to choose from, and they are all free. Just type your keyword in the search bar, and you'll find plenty of relevant results.

You can also choose whether you want to display ads on your site. If you want to keep them off completely, there is an option that allows users who visit your site to download high-resolution copies at no cost (as long as they attribute credit).

## Conclusion

And that's it! I hope these sites help you find the perfect image for your project.

Remember, if you're looking for images that aren't copyrighted or stock photos, you should definitely check out our list of websites where you can also download free photos.
