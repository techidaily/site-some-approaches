## Subtle Sound Level Lowering in FL Studio

Fruity loop studio, also known as FL Studio is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that is one of the best platforms for those who want to learn music production. People who compose audio and produce music mostly prefer FL Studio. It does not matter whether you are an advanced learner in music production or not, you can quickly learn about this as a beginner also. You have to purchase for FL Studio. However, you can try the free trial to get an overview of FL Studio.

There are many features available in FL Studio which help for recording purposes or live performance. You can record your audio to your mac or pc at very ease. It has become a powerful tool for music producers and DJs. Image-Line provides us with another crucial feature for creating professional music. It gives you a clear sound with HD sound for its 64-bit architecture. There is another feature called Delay compensation which creates a fantastic mix without overloading the CPU.

## Part 1\. Steps to Fade Audio with FL Studio

If you want to be more creative and do detailed work, you should get this software.

It can create new sounds through drum machines as a result you can show your creativity to a greater level. FL Studio also provides multiple effects for processing and transforming sound. If you want a smooth transition in increasing and decreasing the volume, then fading plays a major role in every aspect. It is a crucial skill that every musician or music producer should pursue. So, let’s discuss the steps on how to fade audio in FL:

Step1 The first and foremost task to do is the successful installation of FL Studio. Getting the latest version of this will be useful for you as it has a lot of new features.
