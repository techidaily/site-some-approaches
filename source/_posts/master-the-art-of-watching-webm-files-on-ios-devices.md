The light, fast, and fluid WebM is used on many sites like YouTube, Reddit, and 4chan. But iPhone users will be unable to browse WebM videos if they use Safari. Luckily, there are many workarounds.

### Method 1\. Switch to a third-party browser

Safari in iOS doesn't provide native support for WebM videos. What's more, other browsers like Chrome and Firefox also don't support WebM because they must use Apple's Safari web engine, according to [Appleinsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/18/webm-video-support-has-been-added-in-macos-big-sur-113-beta-2). Searching App Store, we have found some dedicated WebM browsers, such as [Frost WebM Player Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frost-webm-player-browser/id1291734828). Frost is compatible with iOS 13 or later. Pay $2.99 and then you can watch WebM videos.

## Part 4\. FAQs about Playing WebM Videos on iPhone

**1\. Does iPhone support WebM natively?**

No. Neither the built-in video player nor browser in iPhone supports WebM video playback. iOS, the operating system used on iPhones, has primarily supported media formats like MP4, MOV, and M4V for video playback. WebM, being an open and royalty-free video format, has not been included in the list of natively supported formats on iOS devices.

**2\. How to watch WebM on iPhone with Chrome?**

Just like Safari, Chrome in iPhone cannot open WebM video. This is because Chrome iOS version also uses Apple's Safari web engine (Apple security rule). By using the Google Chrome app on your iPhone, you can leverage its built-in video playback capabilities to watch WebM videos directly within the browser without the need for additional third-party applications or conversions.

**3\. How can I view WebM on iPhone with Firefox?**

To view WebM videos on iPhone using Firefox: install Firefox: Download and install the Firefox app from the App Store, tap on the Firefox app icon on your iPhone's home screen. Use Firefox to navigate to a website hosting a WebM video you want to watch. Tap the video player or play button on the webpage to start playback. Firefox's built-in video player will handle the WebM format, playing the video within the browser.

**4\. Is WebM supported by Safari?**

Safari, the default web browser on Apple devices, does not support the WebM video format natively. Safari is primarily compatible with media formats like MP4, MOV, and M4V for video playback. Therefore, attempting to play a WebM video directly in Safari may result in an unsupported format error. To watch WebM videos on Safari or Apple devices, users typically need to rely on third-party plugins, converters, or alternative web browsers that offer native WebM support.
