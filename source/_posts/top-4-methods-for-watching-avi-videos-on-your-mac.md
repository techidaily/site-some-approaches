Have you ever tried to open AVI files on Macbook? Did you play them successfully? I guess not. Though QuickTime 7 and QuickTime X (QuickTime Player v10.x) native structures are said to be compatible with AVI, QT X AVFoundation couldn't recognize AVI video unless it's encoded by Motion JPEG, alongside with PCM audio. Moreover, AVI can contain multiple types of video and audio tracks interleaved with each other, which makes it harder to play AVI DivX or XviD files on MacBook.

Therefore, the key to opening and playing .avi files on a MacBook lies in the type of compression codec of the AVI itself. Now that the knot has been found, let's dive deep into the solutions for playing AVI on a Mac.

That QuickTime fails to play your AVI files may be because it doesn't support the AVI' codec. AVI is a container format. It can package various codecs, such as Xvid, DivX and 3ivX. So you need to know how the AVI file is coded and download the right codec for QuickTime to decode it on Mac.

To figure out the codec used to encode AVI, you can open the file with QuickTime and choose Show Movie Info from the Window menu. Then you should be able to find codec information after format properties. Next, you should check if the codec is supported by QuickTime or not. If it is an unsupportive codec, you can download the codec online.

The most popular codecs that can be installed to play AVI on Mac are:

* [3ivxÂ® D4 CODEC](http://www.3ivx.com/download/index.html)
* [DivX for Mac CODEC](https://divx.com/en/software/divx/)

Both add support for a variety of DivX and other formats which often carry the .avi extension. You can download and install either one codec. Once done, open QuickTime and see if it can play your AVI file on Mac now. 

But this method isn't foolproof. Some users report that after installing DivX for Mac, the sound in some AVIs will sometimes be either missing or distorted.
