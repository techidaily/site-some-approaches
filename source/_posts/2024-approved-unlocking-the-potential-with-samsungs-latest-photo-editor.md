The [Samsung photo editor](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/prepost/000005441272?langCd=en) is a default image editor that comes with Samsung devices. However, unlike other devices' default photo editors, the Samsung photo editor is quite charming and more resourceful.

This photo editor has lots of amazing features that rub shoulders with third-party editor apps. Couple with the fact that you can easily access this photo editor directly from your image gallery makes this app unique and easy to use app for Samsung device users.

## Part 2\. Key Features Of Samsung Photo Editor

This app possesses lots of unique and trending features that you can utilize when editing to give your photos that special look you desire.

**Resize Photos:** You can resize your photo whatever you like using the Samsung photo editor. This function enables you to modify the size of the images if you find that they are too wide.

**Supports Collage:** you can create beautiful collages and use as many photos as you want. The ability to individually add various backgrounds and effects to each of the photos is what I find so interesting about this function. This will enable you to make fantastic collages that feature various memorable moments. Nice GIFs can also be created.

**Large Pool of Resourceful Effects:** Samsung photo editor has a lot of beautiful effects that can give your photos the unique, beautiful, and trendy look you desire. It also has color pop-up effects. With its color pop-up effects, you can add color to a section of your photo while the other section remains Monochrome.
