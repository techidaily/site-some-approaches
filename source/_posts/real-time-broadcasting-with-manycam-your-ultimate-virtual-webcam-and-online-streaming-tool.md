## Privacy Policy

Protecting personal information is a core ManyCam value. This privacy statement describes how we collect and use the personal information you provide on our website. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of your personal information and the steps you can take to access this information and to request that we correct or delete it.

ManyCam abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

## Information Collection

As is true of most websites, we gather information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data. We also gather data from Google's Interest-based advertising and 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics. We use this information, which does not identify individual visitors, to analyze trends, to measure visitor usage and interest, to administer and improve the functionality of the website, to track visitors' movements around the site and to gather information about the geographic location of our visitors as a whole. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") about our visitors at this website. No further information regarding our website visitors, other than the browser-level information described above, is collected at this website in any manner whatsoever or for any purpose.

We may also gather information such as Windows OS version, primary monitor resolution, video preset count, and apps used with ManyCam. This information does not identify individual visitors by any means and is only used for the analysis of trends and to help improve our software.

Unless a user has opted out by modifying his/her preferences, upon registration, we may use any e-mail address that we are provided with to notify users of the existence of new contents or promotions in areas concerning which they have expressed an interest. You may request that we stop sending you such notices, at any time thereafter, by following the instructions mentioned in our e-mails.

ManyCam Pro users enter their email address, postal address, and billing data to purchase our software. This data (minus the billing data) is linked to the ManyCam Pro customer's private Pro serial/activation number and the customer's full name, email address, city, state, country, and postal code appears in the ManyCam Pro "About" window. ManyCam Pro user info is sometimes held on our servers and is encrypted. We never store or access any user credit card or any type of payment system billing data on our servers. ManyCam uses professional third party encrypted and secure billing services for billing transactions like [Stripe.com](http://stripe.com/).

You can control which features of your Google Account ManyCam can interact with by going to the [Google Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1) page. Here you can review which applications use your Google Account and revoke access at any time.

However, our business partners do not have any independent right to share or otherwise use your information;
2. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ManyCam’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
