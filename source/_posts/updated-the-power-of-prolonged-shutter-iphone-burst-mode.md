### 1\. Action and sports

 When we hear about action and sports, the terms like speed, energy, and momentum usually start hovering over our minds. Since sports arouse excitement to a great degree, it would be interesting to take those running, skating or cycling moments using iPhone camera burst mode. Using this way of burst mode, you will be having no idea when you will get the chance of getting that ideal and flawless photo. How would it look when you are running and reached at the highest pace and the same moment will be recorded perfectly with burst feature? Wouldn’t it be interesting?

### 2\. Shoot the best portraits

 The iPhone photo burst will fit best when you need to shoot the excellent portraits. Keeping in mind that portrait shots are not a cake walk. The subject can be shy or not static at times or the facial expressions and poses can be weird sometimes. In such case, shooting with continuous shots will be the best option to get a stress free accomplishment of the task. The burst phot will provide more natural and candid appearance to the portrait.

### 3\. Take crystal water and waves

 Another fascinating scenario to make use of burst mode is when you are under water or swimming. The waves and crystal water will look amazingly captivating when captured in your iPhone camera’s burst mode. Also, those bubbles in the water and the crystal clear look inside the water will enhance the picture quality. Therefore, an interesting idea to use burst photography is when you are in your swimming mode.

### 4\. Take something valuable moment

 We encounter many unexpected moments in our daily life such as a bunch of birds flying together in the sky, baby crawling and nothing can be as special as when baby smiles. These unpredictable instants are so pleasant and what’s going to happen at the next moment is clueless to us. When burst mode is there, the possibility to capture these subjects increases. Also, these kinds of unexpected and precious moments can prove opportunistic when you are planning to begin your photography career and building your portfolio.

## Part4: How to disable burst mode in iPhone

 Sadly, there is no such availability to disable the iPhone burst mode. You can’t actually turn off the burst mode camera which is quite disappointing for the users. Therefore, be attentive while taking a selfie or any other photo as holding capture button beyond the expected time will unknowingly capture 20-30 images.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Final Verdict

 That was all about burst photography and recording the best moment possible. iPhone has always made its impression for its exceptional features and stands out at all times. With its burst mode, one can fulfill their wish to catch the most excellent candid pose which normal photography can’t. Be it, moving leaves due to winds, water splashing or rainy view, the burst mode can help under any scenario. Although iPhone offers this burst image feature and no doubt it’s excellent, but if you are looking for professional photography, this will be not worthy enough. We would recommend you to switch to the motion camera to capture those professional shots.

 We hope you had fun reading this article and took as much benefit as possible from it. Thanks for your precious time.
