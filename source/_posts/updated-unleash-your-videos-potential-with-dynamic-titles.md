## Part 2\. Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles

**Utilize Keywords:** Make sure your video title includes important SEO ranking variables since keywords YouTube video results mainly depend on SEO. The SEO keywords you want to rank for should be included in the perfect video names. To find relevant, easily ranked keywords, use a keyword research tool. Additionally, it is best to use competitive but highly searched keywords. Since YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine's ranking formulas are largely the same.

**Video Title Length:** Less than 70 characters make up the best YouTube video titles. Unless you have enough room, avoid including extraneous information in the title, such as the episode number or channel name. Despite YouTube's 100-character maximum for video names, most search engines, including Google, will truncate your title after 70 characters.

**Use Truncation:** Therefore, after you've used up your first 50 characters that are the most crucial, focus on your second part's SEO-friendly components. The second section of your title will still aid in discoverability even if it is abbreviated since Google is likely to utilize the whole thing for ranking. Use the aforementioned YouTube title generating tool if you are running out of ideas.

They will typically base their choice on the appeal of your video title, the beauty of your selected thumbnail, and the applicability of your video description. When someone clicks on your video, it tells Google and YouTube that it's a video that people are interested in watching.

**To increase the impact of your title, use emotive language:** It's crucial to take into account the emotions that viewers could experience while producing content for YouTube. Think about using some important emotion terms in your title if you want it to elicit a feeling. This may increase the impact of your title and draw in readers who are seeking for a certain emotion. You may give viewers an experience that is more powerful and memorable by considering the emotions that your material can elicit in them.

**Include Numbers When Needed:** The likelihood that someone will interact with material given in a numerical format is higher. Therefore, it's crucial to incorporate numbers in your titles if you want people to click on them. It may be useful to include numbers in headlines when it makes sense to do so. This is based on a time-tested marketing principle that still holds true today.

**Add Relevant Words:** Your video's title should briefly describe its subject matter. When people click on videos that don't live up to their expectations, they feel irate and irritated. They make a mental note to stop watching more of your films as they swiftly leave to find a more suitable video. As soon as Google and YouTube become aware of this conduct, your videos start to fall in the ranks.
