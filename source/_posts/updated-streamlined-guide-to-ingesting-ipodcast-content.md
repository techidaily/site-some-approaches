## Why can't I download podcasts on my iPhone?

Having issues with podcast downloads is quite common. In such situations, the episodes might not be downloaded even after clicking on the download button or selecting the download preferences.

Those issues may happen for several reasons, like bugs, glitches, corrupt network settings, etc. Below are some of the most common reasons for the podcast download to fail and their solutions.

### Issue 1\. Temporary glitches

One of the most common reasons downloading episodes’ fail is temporary glitches that might result in the improper functioning of the podcast app.

**The best fix for the issue**

The simplest solution is to force quit and then re-open the podcast app. You can start by opening the iPhone App Switcher using Face ID or swiping up from the bottom of the screen. You can even double-press the Home button for this. Finally, you can even restart the phone to overcome the glitches.

![temporary glitches](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-11.jpg)

### Issue 2\. Permission to use the cellular data

You don't have to be connected to Wi-Fi all the time, and in such situations, the

download will be done using cellular data. So, episodes will not be downloaded if the Podcasts app is not permitted to use cellular data.

**The best fix for the issue**

You need to grant permission to the app for this, go to Settings > Podcasts, and then make sure that the switch for Cellular Data is enabled. Also, check that the switch next to Block Downloads Over Cellular is disabled.

![cellular data permission](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-12.jpg)

### Issue 3\. Server-side Issues

The downloading podcast issues may also arise when there are problems from the server side, not from the app or the device. These issues are represented through a status code, and thus, they can be interpreted using them.

**The best fix for the issue**

To fix this problem, you need to go to the Apple System page and check. Since there is no specific listing for the Podcast app, you would need to find out that there are no issues listed next to services like Apple Music, Apple ID, or App Store.
