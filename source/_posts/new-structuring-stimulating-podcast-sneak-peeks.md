### 5\. Make it interesting for each episode

Each podcast has a unique theme, so it's best to have each one its trailer. But the thing to remember here is that don't use the same intro or lines every time. You have to be unique in every podcast trailer episode. Otherwise, the audience will lose interest in your trailers.

But Wondershare Filmora's Silence Detection is an essential feature as it can help you in auto removing the silent parts of your audio based on your settings.
