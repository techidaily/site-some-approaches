## Part 1\. How Does Reddit Work?

Reddit is a place for gathering. It's where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.

The rules of Reddit are simple.

**Upvotes & Downvotes**

First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.

**SubReddits**

Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance...... you name it!

Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.

The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you're looking for.

**Content and Posting**

The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.

Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.

You'll be fine if it doesn't go against Reddit's guidelines.

**Reddit Karma**

Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.

You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.

## Part 2\. Why Should You Do Reddit Marketing?

The main reason you should learn how to market on Reddit is because of its vast number of daily and monthly users. Let's look at some facts.

* Reddit currently gets **1.7 billion**monthly users
* It is ranked **#19**out of all the other sites on the internet globally
* It is also ranked **#12**among all the websites in the United States

All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.

There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.

Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to **50%** of Reddit users don't use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don't use TikTok as well. Additionally, **90%** of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.

That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It's literally where people go to learn more about your business.

**Create Unique Content and Provide Value for Your Audience**

Content is king when it comes to Reddit. To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience's problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.

It will be worth it in the long run.

**Be Consistent and Persistent**

Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.

There are three major reasons why this is crucial:

\- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later

\- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers

\- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire

**Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs**

AMA stands for "Ask Me Anything". This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.

Feedback is very important for a growing business. It's a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar... the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.

Reddit has its own[AMA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/). It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.

**Always Support Your Audience**

Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.

You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.

For example, when a user asked "[What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/)", the comments were overflooded with the word "Amazon".

**Advertise on Reddit**

There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:

* Takeover Ads
* Promoted Ads

To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.

The first step is to go over as many[examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns](https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/) as you can.

Second, you must familiarize yourself with[Reddit's advertising policy](https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview). Make sure you're not creating an ad that goes against their rules.

Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you're creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?

Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.
