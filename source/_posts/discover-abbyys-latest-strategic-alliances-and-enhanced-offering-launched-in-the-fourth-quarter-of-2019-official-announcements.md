#### _The integration of ABBYY Timeline into the portfolio provides ABBYY customers with a robust offering of innovative solutions to fuel their digital transformation initiatives_ 

  
ABBYY, a Digital Intelligence company, marked several key initiatives during the fourth quarter of 2019 (Q4 2019). Following the [acquisition of TimelinePI](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) in August, Q4 was defined by the integration of what is now ABBYY Timeline into the overall portfolio of products, equipping customers with solutions to leverage both content intelligence and process intelligence to improve operational efficiencies, enhance profit margins, and transform the customer experience.

In October, ABBYY hosted its annual Content IQ Summit to share with customers and partners best practices on how organizations can most effectively leverage ABBYY’s Digital Intelligence technologies to transform their business operations. The event attracted business leaders from around the world who attended engaging program sessions on emerging AI trends, advances in content intelligence, best practices for using process intelligence to accelerate their process automation projects and hands-on workshops designed to help attendees raise their Digital IQ.

In Q4, ABBYY released the results of a global research project that it sponsored from the leading research firm IDC. The study, Content Intelligence for the Future of Work, provides revealing insights into the ways in which global organizations are leveraging content intelligence technologies for projects ranging from customer and employee engagement, digital transformation and intelligent process automation. Among many illuminating findings, the survey quantified the critical contribution of content intelligence for intelligent document processing (IDP) as well as numerous applications in support of robotic process automation (RPA).

“The results of the study reaffirm a key guiding principle of ABBYY’s: that artificial intelligence and software robotics enhance rather than replace human capabilities,” commented Ulf Persson, CEO of ABBYY. “The research reasserts our commitment to foster a future of work defined by human-machine collaboration. We will continue to develop products and solutions that enable and enhance this human-machine partnership. The objective is to help enterprises and organisations achieve tangible positive business results from intelligent automation where digital knowledge workers (robots) and humans work together in a synergistic and complementary manner.”

Below are additional key initiatives that ABBYY welcomed in Q4 2019:
