## Part 1\. How to zoom in on videos on Kinemaster

The built-in feature of Kinemaster enables users to zoom in and out of films and photos. The pen zoom tool, commonly known as a video expanding effect, can be used without downloading additional transitions. With the help of a video editor, ordinary footage can be elevated when used on a Chromebook, tablet, or phone.

As you know, Kinemaster is a robust video editor with many premium features, making it the top video editor for mobile devices. There isn't a zoom-in and zoom-out effect in Kinemaster, but there is an approach that we will learn in this article. Let’s see how to zoom in Video on Kinemaster:

**Steps to put Kinemaster to use**

* Open Kinemaster, and then select the aspect ratio of editing.

* Insert the image or video and then tap on the media icon.

* Once you have entered the image or video, tap the pan icon and zoom in. When you tap on this option, you must choose the end and starting positions.
* You can select the initial point and then set your final position.

* You must use two fingers to adjust the position to enlarge the video or photo.
* It would help if you remembered that you should not activate that equal sign. If you start it, zoom in/out will not work on your video.

That is how you can make a zoom effect on video by using Kinemaster. You can try it out on your own by clicking on the editing video you have above. Make sure you don't go wrong in the abovementioned steps and make your zoom-in or out victorious.
