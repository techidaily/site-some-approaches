If you need to create videos that are tonally consistent and highly similar, such as a company's branding video. Then creating a video template that can be quickly reused will save you a lot of time and allow you to standardize the video style. Making your video template is the same procedure as making a video, pre-setting the tracks and patterns for each part, and finally saving it as a premiere pro project file. Copy the project file, then you can reuse it or share it with others.
