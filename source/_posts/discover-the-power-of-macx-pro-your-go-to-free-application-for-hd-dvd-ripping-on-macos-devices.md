This was my 1st DVD anti CSS program. Having gotten it, I was at loss to buy some other product, think they would all be similar. I was impressed that it could actually remove CSS and I think I made a few OK copies, but also many bad ones. Later, I tried a lot of freeware programs, but then found MacX Free DVD Rip Copy for Mac which works overall very good and a guess a reasonable base for comparing all DVD copy programs!
