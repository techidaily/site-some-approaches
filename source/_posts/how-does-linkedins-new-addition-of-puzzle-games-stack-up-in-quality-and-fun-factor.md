 LinkedIn is the "professional" social network known for bringing people together to share industry news, find jobs, celebrate career wins, and... play games? It's easy to spend a lot of time obsessing over your LinkedIn profile, and now you can kill time playing simple Wordle-esque word games and puzzles, too.

The current selection of word games on LinkedIn

 The first question that comes to mind is, "Who asked for this?" The idea behind [LinkedIn Games](https://www.linkedin.com/games) is to capture the popularity of the [New York Time's "Wordle" craze](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-directly-posting-twitvideos-on-whatsapp/) that has people sharing their performance and tracking their win streaks all over social media.

[There are all sorts of word games available to play if Wordle isn't enough](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-directly-posting-twitvideos-on-whatsapp/), and LinkedIn is hoping that you will be excited to play their word and puzzle games (and share your daily scores with your LinkedIn network). There are currently three word games available on LinkedIn, each with its own unique twist.

##  Pinpoint

An example of the LinkedIn Game: Pinpoint in action

 If you enjoy games that test your word association skills, you might like Pinpoint. You get 5 chances to guess the category that the revealed words all fit into together. Much like Wordle, the goal is to guess the correct answer in as few attempts as possible. When you complete the game for the day, you can share your results on your news feed, and people in your LinkedIn network can try to beat your score.

An example of the LinkedIn Game: Queens

 If you like Sudoku (or [Minesweeper](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/bypass-iphone-6s-plus-activation-lock-without-previous-owner-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/)), then you should check out Queens. Each Queen needs to be placed in a colored section, but Queens cannot be adjacent, and there can only be one Queen per row. This is the most visually focused puzzle game that LinkedIn offers, and some of the daily puzzles are pretty complex! In this game, your score is based on how quickly you can complete the puzzle. You can also share your score when you complete a round of Queens if you think your LinkedIn network is up for the challenge.

##  Crossclimb

An example of the LinkedIn Game: Crossclimb

 Crossclimb is another word game from LinkedIn, and it's an interesting twist on the classic word ladder game. Not only do you have to create a chain of similar words, but you also shuffle the words into a different order and test your trivia knowledge to complete the puzzle. This is the most traditional word puzzle game that LinkedIn offers, and it's more challenging than it seems. Just like Queens, your score is based on how fast you finish the game.

##  Where to Find LinkedIn Games

 If someone in your network is already playing LinkedIn Games, then you might have seen something in your news feed or the "My Network" section inviting you to try the game for yourself. In that case, you'll also see how many of your connections are already playing. If you don't see these games in your news feed, you can also go directly to the source to try these free games and start sharing your scores with your network at [linkedin.com/games](https://www.linkedin.com/games/).

 LinkedIn Games work on both the desktop and mobile versions of the platform, so you can play however you want. It's up to you if you want to share your scores to your LinkedIn news feed, but if you do, keep in mind that this will also show up in the "Activity" section of your profile (like any other LinkedIn post that you might share). But this shouldn't be a bad thing! Colleagues and employers like to see that you have a playful or competitive side. If you like word and logic puzzles, it's worth checking out these daily challenges.
