The demand for online video has been increasing steadily over the course of the last ten years and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. The format in which a video file is saved often determines its quality and size, but as the file’s size decreases so does its quality.

That is the reason why Google developed the WebM file format that preserves a video’s quality while minimizing its size. Even though it has been nearly ten years since the WebM file format was first introduced it is still relatively difficult to find a media player that can play this type of video file. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to play WebM video files and introduce you to six free media players you can use to play WebM videos on Mac and PC computers.

## How to Play WebM Video Files on Windows and macOS without a Media Player?

WebM file format is commonly used for videos that are uploaded to the Internet, as they are relatively small in size and capable of delivering excellent image quality. For instance, YouTube videos in resolutions that vary from 360p to 4K are all saved in the WebM file format. In addition, web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge can all play WebM video files without the help of third-party media players.

In order to play a video saved in the WebM format from the Safari web browser, you must either install the [VLC web browser plugin for macOS X](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html). What’s more, you must make sure that the web browser you’re using to open a WebM video is updated, since older versions of Google Chrome, Opera or Mozilla Firefox cannot open the videos saved in this file format.

Note: If you want to edit the recorded WebM video files, you can check these [best free WebM video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

This is a powerful media player that can play virtually any type of video file. 5K Player supports the playback of 5K, 4K, 360-degree or Full HD videos and it supports nearly all commonly used audio file formats.

## How to Play WebM files on iOS and Android Operating Systems

WebM videos can be played on all Android devices that have Android 2.3 Gingerbread or later version of the OS, without installing a third-party media player.

Installing the [PlayerXtreme Media Player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playerxtreme-media-player/id456584471) will solve this issue, as the app that supports file formats like 3gp, MKV, ISO, or WebM among numerous others.

Even so finding a media player that will enable you to watch WebM videos from a Smartphone, Mac or PC computer shouldn’t be too hard since VLC player is already one of the most commonly used media players in the world.
