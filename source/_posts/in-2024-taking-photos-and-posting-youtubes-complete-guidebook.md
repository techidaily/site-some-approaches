Even though you don't upload content to the platform, you can admit to dedicating a few hours a week to binge-watching other creators' posts. We have associated YouTube with short clips or long videos that keep us indulged and glued to our seats. Apart from posting videos, you can also post photographs on the platform. Here is an article discussing helpful tools and tips on how to post a picture on YouTube.

## How To Upload Photos to YouTube?

We understand that you might still be adamant and wonder whether posting a picture on YouTube is possible. You could either post a photo on the Community tab or convert the image(s) to a short video clip that the platform can accept. Keep reading to learn more about these two methods.

### Method 1\. Post a Picture on YouTube Community

The first method you can use is to post the photo on the Community tab. However, it would be best to remember that this option is only available to YouTube channels with at least 1000 subscribers. We suppose that YouTube doesn't give much recognition to smaller channels that haven't gained much traction.

Here is an easy guide on [how to upload photos on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7124474?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) using the community tab.

**Step 1\.** Open the YouTube platform and click on the "Community" tab.

![open youtube platform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-youtube-platform.jpg)

**Step 2**. Click "Image" to upload a photo from your device.

![upload image to youtube community](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-image-to-youtube-community.jpg)

**Step 3.** Drag and drop the image you want to upload, as shown below.

**Step 7**. Click "Post" to upload your photo to YouTube.

#### Tips

Before you try your hand at posting in the Community tab, read through these tips we have compiled to help your work easier.

* Ensure you check whether community posting on your channel is off. The platform won't make this option available if your primary audience is children or you are using a supervised account.
* Your photo should not exceed 16 MB. Any image you upload above this upper limit will probably be cropped or fail to upload to the tab.
* It would be best to ensure your aspect ratio is 1:1 because this is how they appear on the feed. You wouldn't want the photo to appear zoomed in on the middle ground when you intended to show the entire picture.
* The best file formats to upload to your Community Tab include GIF, JPG, WEBP, and PNG.
* Ensure your photo doesn't violate the YouTube Community Guidelines, lest the moderators take it down. In a worst-case scenario, you might receive a strike. We all know that three strikes will lead to the closure of your YouTube channel.

### Method 2\. Use Image to Video Makers Online to Post Pictures on YouTube

As we mentioned above, YouTube is a platform primarily designed for videos. If the Community tab is not yet accessible, you might wonder how to upload a photo on a YouTube channel. There are various offline and online methods you can use to convert your image to a video clip, which you can then upload to YouTube.

**Tool 1\. Use Image to Video Makers Online to Post Pictures on YouTube**

Developers have been working hard to create online tools to meet your needs and do what they claim. Some great examples include Kapwing, Picovico, Pholody, and Mp3Care. You can check out other excellent examples of online image-to-video makers here.

### Comparison Between Online Makers and Filmora for Uploading Photos to YouTube

So far, we have discussed how to post pictures on YouTube using the methods discussed above. However, you might struggle to determine which option is best for you. We have compiled the table below to compare the two options and help you come up with a final verdict.

Online tools like Pholody are an excellent option if you are always connected to a stable Internet connection. You might also prefer to carry out all your operations on the cloud without downloading additional software to your device.

On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora is great if you need to convert images to videos on the go. You don't need to worry about an Internet connection since you will install the platform on your device. The installation process is pretty straightforward, leaving you with a fully-functioning app.

A major perk of using offline tools is that they are feature-rich. In addition, you won't deal with pesky ads that keep distracting you and disrupting your workflow. On the flip side, be prepared to part with some money since the developers can't allow you to use the free trial for too long.

## Conclusion

By the time you are done reading this article, you should be able to upload a photo to YouTube. If you can't use the Community tab yet, take some time to grow your channel to at least one thousand subscribers and try again. The moderators will make the option available to you. We also hope you will use the video editing tools discussed above to make top-tier videos for your YouTube channel.
