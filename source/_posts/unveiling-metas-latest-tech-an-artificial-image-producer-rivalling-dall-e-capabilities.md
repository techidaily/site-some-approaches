## Unveiling Meta's Latest Tech: An Artificial Image Producer Rivalling DALL-E Capabilities

When we hear the term "generative AI," we associate it mostly with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, but the concept began to go viral with image generators such as [DALL-E](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/tailored-titling-for-stellar-online-video-content-for-2024/). While the initial few versions were pretty primitive, the concept of an AI coming up with images out of the blue with prompts was just wild back then. Big tech companies got into the fun, including Meta, which came up with its image-generation AI model for use within its apps. Now, you can use it standalone if you want to see how well it fares compared to DALL-E.

 Meta's Imagine image generator is now live on its standalone website, allowing you to generate images using the company's generative AI model. It's not based on DALL-E, or another AI model, like Bing's generator, but instead, it uses Meta's in-house Emu AI. Like your regular image generators, you can just put a prompt of how you want your image to look, and the model will generate four images for you per prompt, so you can just choose the one you like the most. All images generated by this AI have a watermark on the bottom left indicating that they were made using Meta's AI, but if that bothers you, the company is apparently coming up with a new invisible watermarking model that withstands cropping, screenshots, and other image manipulations.

 All you need to do is log into the service using your Meta account and you'll be good to go to start generating images. It won't accept your Instagram or Facebook account, unlike other services and sub-services by the company, only Meta accounts (which have been mostly used for Quest VR headsets up until now). Meta is going big into generative AI just like Microsoft and other big tech companies, so this is likely just the beginning.

 If you want to play around with it, you can try it out from the [imagine.meta.com](https://imagine.meta.com/) website. Just remember to sign up for a Meta account before going in, and don't expect masterpieces out of every prompt. It's region-locked, and while we don't have the full list of countries where it's available, you might not be able to check it out from some non-US countries.
