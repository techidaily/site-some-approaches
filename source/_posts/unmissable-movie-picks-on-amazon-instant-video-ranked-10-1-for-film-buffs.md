## Part 3: 5 Best Movies on Amazon.com Recommended by Users

**1\. Reservoir Dogs**  
**Year:** 1992  
**Director:** Quentin Tarantino

Reservoir Dogs is about six criminals, who are hired by a crime boss to carry out a diamond robbery and begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant after the botched diamond heist goes terribly wrong. Every actor in the movie is perfectly fitted for their characters. There are so many cops and robbers movies, but with extreme violence, profane dialogue, nonlinear storytelling and a curated soundtrack, Reservoir Dogs definitely deserves its position on the top ten movies on Amazon and also one of the most violent yet brilliant pieces of work that ever made.

**2\. Into the Wild**   
**Year:** 2007  
**Director:** Sean Penn

This movie is based on a real-life novel. The story centers on the freshly graduated from college who stepped into an adventure and gave up his bright future instead of living in his privileged life. It's about society and family, idealism and aloneness and it portrays the beautiful romanticism of youth and tells a tale of what not to do with your life. Thought-provoking, deep, beautiful, moving, adventurous, it's doubtfully classic that you are not going to miss.

**3\. Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol**  
**Year:** 2011  
**Director:** Brad Bird

In this movie, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returned to his line of work after a short quiet life with his new bride. Kicking off with a thrilling opening sequence, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is the best entry in the Mission Impossible franchise, and one of the best action movies in recent years. It's rare that a sequel trumps its predecessor, however, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, the forth film in the franchise, excels above its predecessors and ranks among the best movies on Amazon with these inventive, relentless, fun and tense scenes. If you are also Town Cruise fan, you may surely hear of the new movie Impossible 5 to be released on July 31.

**4\. The Avengers**   
**Year:** 2012  
**Director:** Joss Whedon

The Avengers is a superhero film about a superhero team. There are Stark, Thor and Banner, Hawkeye and Captain America, there are heroes and villain, good and evil, perfect dialogue and fierce action, delivering everything one can expect from a superhero movie and more. It balances such a team film masterfully. It may be the best film you may seen in this genre.

**5\. Terminator 2: Judgement Day**  
**Year:** 1991

Now another Terminator called the T-1000 is sent back through time, which is more advanced and more powerful than its predecessor to kill John Connor.

This movie may not be the best film on this list, but it's the best sci-fi movie.
