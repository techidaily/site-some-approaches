## Top 7 Insights on Ford's Redesigned Ram 1500: The REV

The all-new Ram 1500 REV electric truck is shaping up to be one of the most capable electric vehicles on the market. The REV promises cutting-edge technology, impressive performance, and tons of towing capacity, which is exactly what most Ram truck buyers expect from the brand.

 After [teasing the first Ram electric truck](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-complete-guide-to-recording-live-tv-on-your-windows-pc/) in 2022, a wild-looking concept debuted in early 2023\. Then, a short time later, Stellantis (the parent company of Ram Tucks) [officially unveiled](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/april/all-new-all-electric-2025-ram-1500-rev-unveiled-at-new-york-international-auto-show-with-targeted-range-of-up-to-an-unsurpassed-500-miles) a more production-ready Ram 1500 REV that's set to arrive sometime in 2024 or 2025\. If you thought the automaker would tame the truck by wrapping its horns in an electrical wire, think again. Here are a few things to know as we patiently await its arrival.

## 1  It Has Unmatched Towing Capacity 

![2025 RAM 1500 REV rear end parked in front of a house.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/my23-ram-rev-1500-feature-gridc-4-display-media-preview-desktop.jpg) 

[RAM](https://www.ramtrucks.com/revolution/ram-1500-rev.html)

 Ram says the 1500 REV will offer the industry's best towing, at least in terms of EVs. The company aims for a maximum towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and 2,700 pounds of payload capacity. That's more than any other [electric truck can tow](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/streamlining-screen-record-on-snapchats-with-your-phone-for-2024/) and far better than the 7,700—10,000 lb limit on the F-150 Lightning. Even Chevy's upcoming Silverado EV in the highest trim can only haul 10,000 pounds.

 Keep in mind that those numbers are for the smaller battery pack option that'll be available on the 1500 REV, and we expect slightly lower numbers for those who opt for the extended-range battery. Ram trucks are known for being tough, rugged, do-it-all vehicles for any job site. If the company wants its loyal base to switch to an EV, it must continue offering capable vehicles. Now, we'll have to wait and see how much towing affects battery life and range.

## 2  It Has Up to 500 Miles of Range 

![RAM 1500 REV truck charging](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ram-1500-rev-charging.jpg) 

[RAM](https://www.ramtrucks.com/revolution/ram-1500-rev.html)

 If there's a benefit from being one of the last major automakers to release an electric truck, it's that Ram knows the competition's weaknesses. Of course, I'm talking about driving range, mainly when owners use these vehicles for "truck things," like towing, which decreases the range.

 The Ram 1500 electric truck will have excellent range thanks to one of two different battery options. The standard option for each trim is a 168.0 kWh battery that the company claims will deliver around 350 miles per charge. A larger 229 kWh package will give buyers around 500 miles, but that's only an estimate. With the gas-powered Ram ditching the V8 Hemi for a twin-turbocharged "Hurricane" V6 in 2024, which should improve mileage, being able to deliver nearly 500 miles in its EV variant is a big deal.

 However, while the 350 and 500-mile estimates are impressive, by the time these trucks officially arrive at the end of 2024, it'll be interesting to see what the competition offers. Who knows, maybe it won't sound as good as it does today.

## 3  The RAM 1500 REV Supports Super-Fast 800V Charging

 Sure, offering a massive battery pack and promising a range of nearly 500 miles is great, but what about charging? That's reportedly another strong suit of Ram's EV. The all-new electric Ram 1500 comes with 800V fast charging technology, which the company says can add 110 miles of range in only 10 minutes on a 350 kW charger.

 We recently suggested that [electric cars should stop trying to be actual cars](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-cast-poco-c65-screen-to-pc-using-wifi-drfone-by-drfone-android/) and that manufacturers should play to the strengths of electrification. Thankfully, it sounds like Ram will do precisely that and offer bidirectional charging on the 1500 REV. This means it'll be able to [power your house](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/conveniently-share-your-videos-youtube-shorts-mobilecomputer-tips-for-2024/) with those huge battery packs. Additionally, owners can take advantage of all its juice during gameday tailgating, outdoor adventures, or at a job site and tap into power outlets in the truck's bed.

## 4  There's a Trim Package for Everyone 

![Ram 1500 Rev rear end with Tungsten package.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2023-09-14-at-10-17-36-am.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
[RAM](https://www.ramtrucks.com/revolution/ram-1500-rev.html)

 While Ram trucks already come in a slew of packages, like the Ram Rebel, TRX, and more, the company is going all-in with its electric truck. That's because the Ram REV will give buyers seven different trim levels to choose from. Seriously.

 During the announcement, Ram confirmed it'll offer all-wheel-drive on every vehicle, two battery configurations, and seven trim levels with varying degrees of luxury, styling, and optional add-ons. We don't know how each model will differ, at least not yet, but you can choose from the base model Tradesman or level up with Big Horn, Laramie, Rebel, Long Horn, Limited, and Tungsten.

 Ram says to look for an eighth trim later, the Ram 1500 REV XR, with a "class-shattering" range. Then, it wouldn't surprise me if 10–14 months after the initial launch, Ram comes out with an insane 1500 REV TRX package. If so, it'll probably use [artificial engine noises](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-google-pixel-fold-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) to sound super aggressive like the upcoming electric Dodge Charger SRT.

Close 

 Considering the Ram 1500 REV only has two battery options and an AWD drivetrain, different trim levels will likely focus on the interior and add-ons. For example, the entry-level Tradesman is a work truck, while the Rebel will have aggressive off-road styling. Then, expect Tungsten to top the charts and cost nearly $90,000 or more.

 In the images above, you can see Ram's stylish interior offering sunroof and moonroof options, massive infotainment displays, and a horizontal LED screen for passengers. Higher trims also come equipped with fancy leather seats, improved audio, and a slew of driver-assist and safety features. The Tungsten trim packs an ultra-premium 23-speaker Klipsch audio system.

 Jumping in the Ram 1500 REV cockpit will feel familiar to any long-time Ram owner. The company will stick to its roots by offering high-quality materials, comfy seats, big screens, and buttons galore.

## 5  The Ram 1500 REV's Specs and Performance 

![Ram 1500 REV electric truck driving on a dirt road in the mountains.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/my23-ram-rev-1500-feature-gridc-5-display-media-preview-desktop.jpg) 

[RAM](https://www.ramtrucks.com/revolution/ram-1500-rev.html)

 As we said earlier, Ram will only offer the two battery pack configurations good for around 350 or 500 miles of range. However, each has different specs, performance, power, and towing capacity advantages.

 According to its press release, the 168 kWh battery should deliver a beefy 654 horsepower and a robust 620 lb-ft of torque. That should be good for a 0-60 mph time of 4.4 seconds and give it the power to tow up to 14,000 pounds. Unfortunately, Stellantis is keeping specs for the bigger model safely guarded behind those Ram horns.

 We'll enjoy AWD with active four-wheel steering for easy maneuverability, adjustable air-ride suspension for improved aerodynamics on the freeway or extra ground clearance for off-road usage, and a powered frunk with best-in-class 15 cu.-ft. of storage.

## 6  How Much the Ram 1500 REV Will Cost 

![Ram 1500 REV front trunk or frunk.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2023-09-14-at-10-21-06-am.jpg)

<a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

[RAM](https://www.ramtrucks.com/revolution/ram-1500-rev.html)

 Now, you're all probably wondering how much it'll cost. Unfortunately, Stellantis hasn't shared any pricing information, but the suggested starting price floating around on the internet indicated by [Kelly Blue Book](https://www.kbb.com/ram/1500-rev/) is $58,000 for the entry-level model. That's likely to compete with the $59,000 Ford F-150 Lightning, but it wouldn't shock me to see it come in slightly more expensive.

 From there, expect to pay more for higher trims like the Big Horn or Laramie, upwards of $75,000 for the Rebel, and probably close to $90K for the flagship Tungsten. And remember, those are MSRP estimates and don't factor in dealer markup, [destination charges](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-essential-hash-monitors-for-facebook-twitter-instagram-for-2024/), and other fees. It's safe to say you'll be opening your wallet to get one.

## 7  When the Ram 1500 REV Will Be Released

[RAM](https://www.ramtrucks.com/revolution/ram-1500-rev.html)

 One of the most important questions is one we still can't fully answer. The official [Ram Trucks website](https://www.ramtrucks.com/revolution/ram-1500-rev.html) says the first-ever electric Ram is coming in Q4 of 2024\. There's a good chance the automaker will only deliver a few of these trucks in 2024, and for most buyers, it'll be available in early 2025.

 Furthermore, expect limited availability and trim levels initially, with the company likely trying to push more expensive trims out first to recoup costs. Unless something changes between now and the end of 2024, the Ram 1500 REV will be an exciting new electric truck with plenty to offer when it finally starts appearing at dealer lots in 2025.
