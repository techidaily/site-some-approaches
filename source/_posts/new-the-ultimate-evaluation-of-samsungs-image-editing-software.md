## Part 1\. What is Samsung Photo Editor

The [Samsung photo editor](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/prepost/000005441272?langCd=en) is a default image editor that comes with Samsung devices. However, unlike other devices' default photo editors, the Samsung photo editor is quite charming and more resourceful.

This photo editor has lots of amazing features that rub shoulders with third-party editor apps. Couple with the fact that you can easily access this photo editor directly from your image gallery makes this app unique and easy to use app for Samsung device users.

## Part 2\. Key Features Of Samsung Photo Editor

This app possesses lots of unique and trending features that you can utilize when editing to give your photos that special look you desire.

**Resize Photos:** You can resize your photo whatever you like using the Samsung photo editor. This function enables you to modify the size of the images if you find that they are too wide.

**Supports Collage:** you can create beautiful collages and use as many photos as you want. The ability to individually add various backgrounds and effects to each of the photos is what I find so interesting about this function. This will enable you to make fantastic collages that feature various memorable moments. Nice GIFs can also be created.

**Large Pool of Resourceful Effects:** Samsung photo editor has a lot of beautiful effects that can give your photos the unique, beautiful, and trendy look you desire. It also has color pop-up effects. With its color pop-up effects, you can add color to a section of your photo while the other section remains Monochrome.

**Stickers:** if you love adding stickers to your photos then you have no worries because the Samsung photo editor had lots of stickers you can apply to your photos.

**Rich Array of Color Selection:** the large color collection of the Samsung Galaxy photo editor is the real deal when you want to create colorful beautiful pictures. You can apply these colors to change your photo's color tones.

**Shadow and Reflection Removal:** this feature is one of the unique features of this photo editor because you will rarely see it in other photo editor apps. You can remove shadows and reflection that makes your photos suck. Having unwanted shadows or reflections on your photos can be really annoying however, with the Samsung editor you don't need to worry about it.

**Draw on Photos:** you can draw objects on your photos with this photo editor. The brush can be changed to the desired size. For your drawings, you can also select colors and a brush technique. An adjustable eraser is available to you if you make a drawing error.

**Review Original Photo:** Through the Original Review function, you can keep track of how much editing you have done to your photographs. With this function, you can modify a photo while comparing your changes to the original. If you don't want to completely alter the original version of your images after editing them, this will help you stay in check. You can save the edited version after changing it separately from the original.
