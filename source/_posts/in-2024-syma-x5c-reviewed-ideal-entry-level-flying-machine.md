#### 2. Design

 This device has maximum dimensions of 12x12x8 inches and the weight goes up to 2 pounds. It consists of four motors inside that possess individual control over single blade type propeller. With these additional blades, the quadcopter is able to gain more speed during flight and it also makes this device more strength full while adding ability to perform impressive flips. LED lights are attached to each propeller so that users can have perfect control over drone even during night hours. One additional protective layer is provided by a guard cage for the blades. The outer edge possesses a highly flexible yet durable plastic guard cage.

#### 3\.  Battery Life

 The average recorded flight time of this unit is about 6 to 10 minutes that is powered from 500mAh batteries with 3.7Volt rating. This high quality battery can hold charge perfectly but you need to spend about 100 minutes for recharging of drone batteries. This quad possesses only one battery in the package but if you want to enjoy more flights then you can prefer to buy spare batteries.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

 This device possesses regular flight mode as default mode so users need not to make much efforts for its flight arrangements.

![syma x5c controller](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-x5c-controller.jpg)

 The remote unit or transmitter works with a 2.4GHz frequency setting with 4 channel type control. It helps pilots to enjoy wider flying range with spread spectrum technology. The maximum flying range falls between 30 to 50 meters and no lags have been reported yet in control selection and quadcopter reactions. Using flip switch, you can directly adjust the movements in air.

#### 6\.  Camera

![syma x5c camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-x5c-camera.jpg)

 Syma H5C camera is rated as moderately stable and it is capable enough to take impressive pictures from air. This device is equipped with a 2GB MicroSD card that offers personal storage space to all recorded videos and images. The sad part is here that controller unit of this device is able to send signals to drone only; it cannot control the camera actions. Thus your camera stays focused in only one direction all the time and have fixed focus during shoots. You cannot apply zoom, direction sensing inputs or focus adjustment controls when your device is in air. If you are searching for a highly controlled footage generator then it is good to go for other Phantom series and other competing models as per your budget. But Syma H5C is really a good choice to start with.

## Conclusion

 Syma's X5C can be included in the list of must buy product for beginners due to its all incredible features. If you are a beginner and are just going to learn about flight basics then this advanced camera unit can serve you best with all impressive controls.
