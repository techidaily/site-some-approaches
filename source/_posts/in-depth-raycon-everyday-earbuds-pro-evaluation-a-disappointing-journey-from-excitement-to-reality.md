## In-Depth Raycon Everyday Earbuds Pro Evaluation: A Disappointing Journey From Excitement to Reality

### Key Takeaways

* While the Raycon Everyday Earbuds Pro look cool and fit well, the sound quality falls short and is inconsistent across genres.
* The touch controls can be finicky, and the lack of a companion app limits customization options.
* Despite a decent 40-hour battery life, the Pro buds' overpricing for subpar audio quality makes them hard to recommend to most users.

 I really wanted to say more nice things about the [Raycon Everyday Earbuds Pro](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1328340&u=4338022&m=87109&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fengwe.pxf.io%2Fjrkzrn&afftrack=techidaily), but in testing, it was a tough product to love. Sure, they look cool and fit nicely, but the sound quality is terrible. To top it off, they’re on the pricey side so I would recommend most people skip these earbuds.

##  Design: The Best Part

 Raycon’s earbuds are frequently lauded for their sleek and semi-futuristic cosmetics, and I’m here to join the praise parade. The Everyday Earbuds Pro look super-cool. Right now, the only color is Silk White, a motif shared by the buds and charging case. The back of each bud includes a silver, metallic surface for touchpoint controls. The matte finish on both the buds and case felt good on the fingertips, too (sometimes it’s the small things).

 The box contents include multiple ear tip sizes, a USB-C cable, user manuals, and a Raycon sticker.

##  Comfort, Controls, and Codecs: Good Fit, Iffy Touch Controls

![A pair of Raycon Everyday Earbuds Pro in their case](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/a-pair-of-raycon-everyday-earbuds-pro-in-their-case_53573460599_o.jpg)

 The Pro buds come with a few different ear tip sizes, in both gel and memory foam. I never needed to swap the tips though, as the ones pre-attached fit me just fine. In fact, I found the Pro buds very comfortable to wear for long periods. They felt secure too. With the IPX5 rating, I can see these being ideal for gym-going and outdoor runs.

 Controls are relegated to touchpoints on the rear of each bud. Taps and long presses are used for playback, volume, noise-canceling mode, voice assistants, switching between audio presets, and answering/hanging up calls. When these controls worked, they worked great; but there were often times that I’d tap, tap, and tap again, and nothing would work. Then all of a sudden, everything would be fine. It was weird.

 As far as noteworthy audio tech goes, the Pro buds support the SBC and AAC codecs, as well have Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. I also thought Bluetooth Multipoint worked well. When switching between devices, I had to pause source A before source B could start playing, but that’s pretty common for Multipoint products.

##  Noise Canceling: Makes the Grade

 The Pro buds deliver acceptable noise cancellation. I can’t say I was ever wowed by the ANC performance, but it definitely works. My apartment’s HVAC system is rather loud, and the Raycon's did a nice job of pulling most of the low-end fan noise away from my ears. Add in some music, and having ANC enabled was the icing on the isolation cake.

 Some distracting sounds still made it inside my ears though. For example, I could hear the landscapers right outside my apartment plain as day (I never knew people could leaf-blow for so long). On the flip side, the transparency mode is solid, providing just enough amplification to the world around me. You can also have ANC and transparency disabled.

 Unfortunately, because there’s no companion app, you won’t be able to customize how weak or strong the ANC is.

##  Sound Quality: The Letdown

![Top view of the Raycon Everyday Earbuds Pro](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/top-view-of-the-raycon-everyday-earbuds-pro_53573578870_o.jpg) 

Sergio Rodriguez / How-To Geek

 Now we’ve come to the part of the review where true disappointment sets in. I’m subscribed to several YouTube channels that have Raycon sponsorships, and the good word of these content creators really spiced up my expectations for these buds. But unfortunately, when it comes to sound quality, they’re just not very good. I didn’t want to believe it either, but the combination of bombastic bass and harsh sibilance is simply too hard to ignore.

 Mind you, the Pro buds didn’t sound terrible with every test track I put them through, but the lack of consistency between genres was distracting. On progressive metal band The Contortionist’s track “[Language I: Intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0Bc4pkSGfU),” a swelling medley of synth, clean guitars, and melodic vocals culminates in bouts of distorted instruments and screamed vocals. When steeped in the clean sections, low-end and mids were decent, but the crystalline guitar tone was a literal pain to my ears.

 Switching to the "Balanced" preset leads me to my next complaint: the three sound presets aren’t good enough. The second preset, "Bass," adds way too much low-end for most songs; to the point where higher-bitrate Apple Music tracks started sounding like mushy, compressed MP3s. Switching to "Pure Sound" simply rips _all_ the bass out of the mix, so you’re left with nothing but grating highs.

 Panic at the Disco!’s “[Death of a Bachelor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R03cqGg40GU)” is a normally well-mixed and exciting song, but the Pro buds rained on this, too. Again, a big struggle with sibilance, and quite the limited soundstage. “Bachelor” is a big-sounding song (and album), but the Raycon's ate away at much of the sonic gravitas.

 I’ve been on a “[Half in the Bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6LDZSi-lzU&t=7s)” YouTube kick of late, and even just two mild-mannered guys riffing about movies on a closed set lost something with the Pro buds. The same goes for my weekly dose of “WTF with Marc Maron.” Dialogue-driven content seems to suffer the most from the harsh high frequencies.

 Not even the built-in white noise generator on my iPhone sounded normal. This was all a huge bummer for me, considering the fanfare.

##  Call Quality: A Plague Called Crackles

 I wanted the call quality to be the redeeming hero, but the Pro buds fall short here, too. My test calls sounded _fine_. But beyond being able to simply hear the person I was talking to, there was a distracting amount of compression occurring at all times. There are six mics built into these buds, on top of hybrid ANC, but these engineering specs didn’t shine through.

 What was even worse was the intermittent crackling that took place throughout entire test calls. It kept sounding like the buds were going to disconnect from my phone when it was only 25 feet away (at the most).

##  Battery Life: About Average

 Raycon claims the Everyday Earbuds Pro should last for up to 10 hours on a full charge, with an extra 30 playback hours provided by a fully charged case. The case itself supports USB-C and wireless Qi charging. The Pro buds also support quick-charging capabilities, with just 10 minutes in the case netting you an extra 1.5 hours of playback.

 I never needed to give the buds a full recharge while testing them, and can certainly stand behind the quick-charge stats. Most of the time, I was able to keep the Buds Pro at 100% battery; and they only dropped as low as 60% after about 4 hours of use. That was at 80% volume with ANC enabled.

##  Should You Buy the Raycon Everyday Earbuds Pro?

 The [Raycon Everyday Earbuds Pro](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1328340&u=4338022&m=87109&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fengwe.pxf.io%2Fjrkzrn&afftrack=techidaily) are not all they’re cracked up to be. Cosmetics and comfort only go so far for audio peripherals, and these buds [seriously lag behind the competition](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/locked-out-of-apple-iphone-xs-max-5-ways-to-get-into-a-locked-apple-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/). If you're looking for alternative options, I’ve tested other products [that cost less](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-youtube-success-with-tubebuddy/) and [sound much better](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/download-your-next-read-without-spending-17-great-free-book-websites/).

 I’d buy one of those sets instead, folks.
