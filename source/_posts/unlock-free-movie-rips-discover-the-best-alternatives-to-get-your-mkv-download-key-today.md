 _\-- "Going to makemkv.com, the forums, etc. all result in some page in Cyrillic, which upon translating states that the website is suspended. Hopefully MakeMKV down problem won't exist long as I can't rip my DVD now."_

_\-- "Just wondering if anyone has heard any news about makemkv. I go to their site now and the domain is blocked."_

_\--"Makemkv not working for me, which alternative can I use that's like, literally, absolutely, free. Freemake is annoying with the bullshit text including in the rip unless you pay for it. Oh, and I can't get HandBrake to work with the DVDs I'm trying. Any other alternative free DVD ripper to deal with protected discs?"_
