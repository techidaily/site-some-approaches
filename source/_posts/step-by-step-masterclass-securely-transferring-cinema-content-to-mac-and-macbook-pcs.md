## Part 1\. How to Download Netflix Movies on MacBook

Netflix is always your top choice when it comes to the top streaming service to watch movies, TV series or shows. It creates countless classic originals, from House of Cards, Black Mirror to Squid Game, Arcane. The question is - when you're in a 5-hour plane trip or long time road trip towards your summer vacation destination, you prefer to watching Netflix movies or TV series on a bigger screen for better visual experience and eye friendness. Your MacBook is superior to your iPhone iPad at this point. 

Well, another question comes. Technically, you can't directly download Netflix movies on your MacBook as there is no Netflix app for Mac version and the Netflix website doesn't support downloading functionality that you can find on your iPhone and iPad.

In such case, you have another 3 ways to download movies from Netflix on Mac for later offline watching.

## Part 9\. How to Download Movies on Mac with BitTorrent for Mac 

BitTorrent I mentioned here means a BitTorrent client. Thanks to simple interface, BitTorrent for Mac is not difficult to get hang of it for novice users. It gives you access to numerous movie video files. The search box brings great convenience to find movie resources (even some free Netflix movies, Amazon Prime movies, YouTube movies, included). My beef with this solution is that it downloads movies on Macbook to one folder but leaves a large number of torrent files on desktop. Sometimes, it takes half a day to save a full movie to a Mac, which is unacceptable. 

### How to use BitTorrent to Download Full Movies to MacBook

 **Step 1\.**  Find and download torrent files you want to your MacBook Pro/Air, or other [best Mac computers for movie editing](https://fixthephoto.com/best-mac-for-video-editing.html).

To solve this, you need to [convert movies from MKV to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or other Mac best formats. 

_**Disclaimer:** It's illegal to download copyrighted material without the written authorization of the copyright owner. We don't encourage any user to illegally download movies on Macbook. Movie fans are recommended to go to legal movie streaming sites, such as YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime Video, to watch movies on Macbook._
