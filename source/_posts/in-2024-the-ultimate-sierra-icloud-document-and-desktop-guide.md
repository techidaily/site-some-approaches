2. You can find the iCloud Drive under Favorites in the Finder window. When you are in the window, you can click “Go Menu” and choose iCloud Drive. Another thing, you can click Shift – Command – I.

* **When you are utilizing another Sierra Mac:**

Any file will appear automatically in its Desktop and Documents folder as long as it has internet access. **You will notice that in a particular finder window, a folder appears under iCloud. When it comes to the OS X previous versions, it appears in favorites.**

* **If you are using the other Mac devices that do not have MacOS Sierra:**

Desktop and Documents are still accessible when you have an internet connection. When you are in a finder window, you should click the “Go Menu” and select “iCloud Drive.” In this manner, you can see all the folders you need. Nevertheless, there are things to bear in mind as follows:

All your files in the local device of a non-Sierra Mac will not be saved automatically to iCloud Drive. When you want to access all those documents, you have to save them **manually** to iCloud Drive’s Desktop and Documents. After that, you can see whatever file you need to access on your Sierra Mac.

When it comes to the Sierra Public Beta 2, you ought to move the files. You do not have to copy all of them. In copying files from iCloud Desktop or Document folder when utilizing a non-sierra Mac, you just need to right-click the “file” and select “Copy.” On your non-Sierra Mac, right-click the “Destination” and click “Paste Item.”

Presently, Sierra is in beta, which means that there will be changes regarding how all these things work in the near future.

To sum it up, if you want to save and access any file but you do not know what to employ, you can count on the MacOS Sierra. Instead of using printed materials, saving your files through MacOS Sierra is better. Surely, you can have an experience that you will always love and appreciate.
