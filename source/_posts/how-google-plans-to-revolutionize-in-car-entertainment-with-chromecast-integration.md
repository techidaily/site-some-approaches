## How Google Plans to Revolutionize In-Car Entertainment with Chromecast Integration

Android Auto and CarPlay are two of the biggest upgrades to the infotainment experience in vehicles over the last several years. At Google IO 2024, Google announced a new initiative to improve Android Auto apps, add new features, and Google Cast for cars powered by Android Automotive.

 Sure, using Android Auto is great, as it can [bridge the gap between your phone](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-itel-a60-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) and any of the many screens inside our vehicles. Additionally, modern cars now offer Google Built-in, powered by Android Automotive OS. It's a bit different from Android Auto, delivering a native system that provides a safe, seamless, and better experience for drivers and passengers.

 In a blog post, the company announced that Google Cast (the technology used in Chromecast streaming devices) is coming to cars powered by Android Automotive. And while the list is somewhat short, including Rivian, Nissan Rogue, [Ford Explorer](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/how-chatgpt-skyrocketed-unveiling-5-key-reasons-for-its-rapid-rise/), and dozens more, it's growing by the day. Once the update arrives, you can easily cast video and app content from your phone right to your vehicle's infotainment display.

 Using Google Cast in Android Automotive vehicles is a big deal. It's beneficial for apps that are incompatible with Android Auto or don't play well with car screens. Owners can simply wirelessly share the content from the app to their vehicle display. It'll be available first on the [Rivian R1T](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/voice-memo-savvy-tips-and-tricks-for-success/) and R1S, then to others soon.

 Then, for nearly 200 million [cars compatible with Android Auto](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-track-imei-number-of-honor-90-lite-through-google-earth-by-drfone-android/), the app ecosystem as a whole is about to improve. These days, many apps don't work with Android Auto, and even if you sideload the app into your car, the experience or interface may be lacking. As a result, Google has unveiled new [initiatives and tools](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/parked/car-ready-mobile-apps) to streamline the process of bringing existing apps to cars.

 Future apps can be categorized as "Car Ready" and will at least work on the larger screens when a car is in park. Then, Google aims to work with developers to ensure apps are optimized to run in vehicles with the proper interface, safety features, parked modes, and works great on the center infotainment display.

 Finally, a third tier will represent apps that deliver the best vehicle experience. These apps can adapt to display best across the middle console, rear or passenger infotainment displays, instrument clusters, and even panoramic displays like those seen on many luxury EVs. Basically, Google wants to help developers create stunning Android apps that elevate the entire in-car experience.

 In the coming months, the "Car ready mobile apps program" will bring more mobile apps to cars with no additional work for developers, and Google will proactively find and approve apps for Android Auto. Basically, the app situation in our vehicles is about to get even better while still being as safe as possible.
