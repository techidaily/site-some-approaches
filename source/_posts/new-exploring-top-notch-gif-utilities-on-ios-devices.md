If you consider yourself to be a fan of the Boomerang app, then you are going to love using LoopVid, because it enables to capture goofy videos. The length of the video can vary from 1 to 9 seconds and the app creates an endless sequence that is perfect for capturing motion, falling objects or anything else that has a repetitive rhythm.
