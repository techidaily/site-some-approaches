## Why Can't I Play a Podcast on My iPhone?

If your iPhone is not playing podcasts, there's usually a problem with downloading or syncing the podcast with other devices.

3. Ensure the appropriate audio output is chosen.
4. Redownload the podcast after erasing it from your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. When downloaded, files can sometimes become corrupt.
