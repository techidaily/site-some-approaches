 Before using the iPhone live photo app or going iPhone camera live, here are some essential information to keep in note of-

 It takes a total of 3 seconds to record a video for 1.5 seconds and followed by capture image 1.5 seconds. As it is recording live pictures iPhone device already captures the 1.5 seconds leading to the shutter button press, and saves it along with the rest 1.5 seconds for image capture.

 Sharing the photos is an interesting part and if you think you will be unable to share the iPhone live photos, then you are mistaken. You can share live photo to devices runing iOS 9 or above. The OS X El Capitan also supports sharing the Live photos.

 Remember one thing that while you open the iPhone live photos app, the audio option is always switched on. So, whatever you speak, shout, or discuss will be clearly recorded in the video. Keep in mind that shouting at the top of your voice and asking a person to move so that you can click a great view or moving pictures on iPhone can spoil your live photos. So, beware.
