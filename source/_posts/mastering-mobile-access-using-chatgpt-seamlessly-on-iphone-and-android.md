##  Does ChatGPT Have an App?

 OpenAI now offers [an official ChatGPT app for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069), and [an Android app is on the way](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-use-apple-maps-on-a-windows-pc/). There is also a mobile-friendly version of the ChatGPT website. The public ChatGPT API was [released in March 2023](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/roblox-launch-woes-master-these-fixes-for-a-smooth-gaming-experience/), which means developers can integrate ChatGPT's AI language model into apps.

 There are also a lot of [fake ChatGPT apps](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-oneplus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) in the App Store and Play Store. Many of these apps claim to be "powered by ChatGPT," but they're not. The safest way to use ChatGPT on your phone is through the official app or the official website ([chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/).) You can also use [Microsoft's Bing app](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-expert-recorder-choice-for-high-quality-youtube-content/), which uses the same language learning model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT.
