## The Battle of AV1 and VP9: Outcomes Revealed

The advancement in video technology means there are many video codecs to use. Today, you can use  VP9, AV1 and other codecs on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, Vimeo, and more. However, video codecs differ regarding file size, licensing, quality, and more. Now this brings us to the exciting **AV1 vs VP9** comparison. These two are currently some of the most widely used video codecs, especially on YouTube. So, which one should you use? Should you stick to the trusted VP9 or the brand-new AV1? This article helps you make the critical choice.

## Part 1\. What is VP9?

Released in 2013 by Google, VP9 is a free, open-source video codec that replaced VP8\. This compression algorithm was released to compete with  a licensed video codec. VP9 enjoys broad support among modern HTML5 web browsers. In fact, VP9 has been compatible with Android since version 4.4 KitKat. This codec is also compatible with iOS/iPadOS 14 or newer.

In the meantime, a 2014 comparison between VP9 and /AVC discovered that VP9 offers a 45% bitrate advantage over. Netflix also concluded in 2016 that VP9  could have the same efficiency after tweaking the parameters. So overall, VP9 supports lossless encoding of raw bitstreams, making it perfect for streaming videos in MP4 and WebM.

## Part 2\. What is AV1?

AV1 is a relatively new video codec by Alliance for Open Media, a consortium of which Google is a co-founder. Like VP9, it's a royalty-free video codec, meaning you don't have to pay licensing fee to use it. AV1 was developed to replace VP9, so expect it to be compatible with all VP9-supported platforms. Besides Google, the Alliance for Open Media also includes Netflix, Amazon, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla.

The first AV1 version was released in 2016 but was held back due to unresolved critical bugs. Then in March 2018, the Alliance announced another release alongside software encoder/decoder. Although the codec is primarily designed to compete with licensed codecs like  AVC, there are concerns that it may threaten the existence of other royalty-free codecs. But as a consumer, freebies are always a welcome addition.

## Part 3\. Detailed Comparison Between VP9 and AV1

For viewers to enjoy high-quality content without using a lot of resources, efficient video compression technology is a must. As it stands, both VP9 and AV1 are royalty-free codecs, meaning that they are 100% free to use. However, these codecs differ. Here is what we've gathered for the **VP9 vs AV1** comparison:

### Compatibility - VP9 has an edge

Both video compression techniques are relatively new, which AV1 being the latest. This means VP9 and AV1 are compatible with various HTML5 browsers and devices. Google says VP9 decoding is compatible with more than 2 billion endpoints, meaning you can open VP9 on Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Android smartphones/TVs, and local media players.

![compatibility](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-1.jpg)

But on the other hand, viewers might experience an "error" message when opening AV1 locally on your old PC. While Intel works around the clock to develop supported drivers, some may not be compatible with your old computer. But expect wider AV1 compatibility now that more tech companies like Meta, Samsung, and Apple have joined the Alliance for Open Media. Currently, YouTube and Netflix are already streaming some videos in AV1.

### Performance - AV1 has an edge

Regarding practical performance, it's widely agreed that AV1 has the upper hand over standard codecs like VP9, and VP8. According to a test by EpsosVox on Intel's AV1 encoder, the codec showed higher performance efficiency than NVIDIA's NVENC, OBS x264, and AMF by AMD. The test results showed that the AV1 encoder is 16% better than the competing encoders.

Another 2018 Facebook Engineering (now Meta) test showed that AV1 achieved 34% higher compression than VP9\. The test also showed that AV1 is 50.3% and 46.2% better than the x264 main profile and x264 high profile. However, the test showed that AV1 requires a longer encoding duration than the current alternative due to the complexities involved.

![facebook av1 vs vp9 comparison](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-2.jpg)

Most importantly, Facebook suggested that AV1's performance significantly increases with increased video resolution. This means viewers will enjoy a higher quality 8K and UHD/4K content when using AV1 than VP9 and other codecs. And yes, higher compressions by AV1 mean a smaller file size at the same bitrates as the VP9 codec.

### Into the Future - AV1 is the Trend

You probably know that AV1 comes from VP9 and is having difficulties in widespread use due to longer decoding times. But things are different now.

In the year of 2022, AV1 hardware encoder made amazing progress in supports from graphics card manufacturers—August, Intel's new Arc Alchemist GPUs integrates with AV1 encoding and the Intel Arc AV1 Encoder Easily Beats AMD and Nvidia.

YouTube Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LznXh5lkgB0>

Soon in the September, NVIDIA unveiled the GeForce RTX® 40 Series of GPUs, which comes with Dual NVIDIA Encoders (NVENC) that is able to "cut export times by up to half and feature AV1 support".

![cut export times](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-3.jpg)

Let alone AV2 is upcoming in 3-5 years. There is no doubt that AV1 is the future trend.

### What is the best video codec?

There's nothing like the "best video codec" because it depends on user preference.  Although it offers universal compatibility, its performance is far behind codecs like AV1, and VP9. Also, it's a licensed video codec, one reason why YouTube stopped streaming.

### Can I open AV1 videos on VLC?

You can open AV1 on VLC version 3.0.0, released on February 2018\. Remember that VideoLAN, the developer of VLC Media Player, is a member of the Alliance for Open Media.

### When will AV2 be released?

After multiple tests to compare AV1 and H.266, it was discovered that the former lags in numerous aspects. As a result, Alliance for Open Media had to go back to the drawing board to design AV2\. But don't expect this codec until at least 2024 to 2025.

## Summary
