### #3 Post your podcast on the Instagram feed

To post a podcast on the Instagram feed, you must ensure that your feed looks attractive and the podcast post has good audio results. For this, keep in mind the following tips.

##### Tip 1\. Create a Stunning feed

A feed of your podcast Instagram page should look pleasing. Curate it to make people want to know what your next steps are, whether they are vivid, elegant, or fun, but most importantly, give it your own unique flair.

You must think of a situation in which a visitor would quickly be able to identify a post as being published by you based only on your unique syntax.

##### Tip 2\. Quality audio content

Instagram is a visual platform that attracts an audience more by sound quality and presentation of a post. You are promoting your podcast on the Instagram post; for this, your post should have pleasant highlights of the Podcast.

Highlights of the podcast should contain the main purpose of the podcast and some clicks of guests.

##### Tip 3\. Color scheme of Instagram feed

Here, choosing colors for your podcast's brand will be quite helpful. Why? So when making visuals for your feed, you will continue to utilize that color scheme. Consider the feelings you want your account to convey.

![color scheme for instagram feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/color-scheme-for-instagram-feed.jpg)

For example, you may choose green and earth tones for a cottagecore podcast about rural life instead of a crime podcast, which would work well with mysterious, dark colors.

##### Tip 4\. Post consistently

In a nutshell, consistency is important with Instagram. There is consistency when it comes to how frequently, when, and what kind of content you post. Your posts should ideally be made regularly enough for your followers to know when to expect new content from you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### #4 Post your video podcasts to IGTV

Instagram just introduced the IGTV function, which allows users to submit movies longer than **60 seconds**. This is an excellent spot to provide a longer preview of what's to come if you currently capture videos about your podcast.

You can also publish a blooper reel or other content that will support the blooper video or other content that will attract your audience to pay attention to what you have to say.

![video podcast on igtv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/video-podcast-on-igtv.jpg)

**Did You Know?** Most Instagram users log in regularly, and one-third of fans watch multiple times daily, making IGTV the ideal medium for promoting your podcast.

### #5 Paste the episode link in your Instagram bio

Because Instagram is a visual medium, your bio is the only area on Instagram where you may include a personal link. Use this instead of the restricted messaging options available (such as post captions, etc.).

Include a call to action asking your followers to visit your bio and click the link in each Instagram post you make.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Invest in sponsored content for your podcast on Instagram

Of course, having a small audience should allow you to receive views on your blog. Turning your posts into advertising will improve clickthrough rates, sophisticated targeting, and unique post styles. This is another option for posting a podcast on Instagram.

Depending on your goals, you can pay anywhere from 20 cents to $2 CPM (cost per thousand views or impressions). Your post will appear on the feeds of your chosen audience once your ad is live and running.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg" border="0">vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call 
This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sponsored content looks like](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/instagram-sponsored-content.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You'll note that advertisements are sold the same way ads for your podcast are sold.

By making your post a sponsored commercial, you may direct visitors to your website, much like the swipe-up function of Instagram Stories.

### 2\. Add hashtags to spice up your IG feed for podcasts

"**Hashtag**" was a popular term during the time social media was first being started. But learning how to utilize it effectively is helpful when marketing your company or spreading your identity to a bigger audience.

Create a unique hashtag for your podcast and use it whenever you publish or when your guests share anything connected to it. It will compile all your material into one place, directing users to all posts mentioning your podcast whenever they click on your hashtag.

![podcast has over 9m posts on instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/podcast-post-on-instagram.jpg)

**Make your hashtag**

Create a unique hashtag for your podcast and use it whenever you publish or when any of your guests share anything connected to it.

It can compile all of your material into one place, directing users to all posts mentioning your podcast whenever they click on your hashtag.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![a double dose includes their own hashtag on every post](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/podcast-hashtag-on-instagram.jpg)

**Use other Hashtags**

On the other hand, using additional hashtags demands greater planning and investigation. Such as you can choose top instagram hashtags like:

* #lifestyle
* #instagood
* #photooftheday
* #art
* #beautiful
* #photography
* #happy
* #cute
* #follow
* #nature
* #like4like
* #followme
* #fitness
* #food
* #nofilter
* #dog
