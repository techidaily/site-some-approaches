## Part 2\. Key features of PicsArt app

The PicsArt free app has a lot of amazing features for editing photos however, we are going to list the key features of this app that makes it stand out from other photo editing apps.

**Photo and Artwork Remix:** this is one of the features that the photo edit app PicsArt, has that makes it unique and different from other photo editing apps. With this feature, you can be able to remake a picture or artwork that has already been edited by another user. Once a picture has the "free to edit" hashtag you can pretty much do anything you want with the picture.

This feature boasts resourceful tools that help you create a beautiful collage. It is also pretty easy to use these tools, you just have to do a few drag and drop, and clicks.

**Magic Effects:** PicsArt allows you the opportunity to create beautiful artwork out of a photo through its AI-powered filter. The juicy part about this feature is that you can apply these filters to a part of your picture while the other part remains the same. Amazing Right? This is a whole new level from what you see with other photo editor apps with AI-powered filters.

**Drawing Tool:** with over 20 brush types that translate on a 3D plane, PicsArt has given artists the go-ahead to create amazing, beautiful works of art using the app. It photoshop-layers gives you the feeling of drawing on photoshop.
