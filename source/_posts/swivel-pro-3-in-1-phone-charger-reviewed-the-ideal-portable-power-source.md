##  Who Is this 3-in-1 Charger For?

Close 

 The first time I saw the Journey Swiv 3-in-1 wireless charger, I assumed it would be a great option for travel. The side MagSafe iPhone charger part folds up and covers the Apple Watch charger, which the company says reduces its size by 40%.

 After seeing the charger in person, however, I’m not convinced its best use is actually out of the house. It doesn't fold up completely and it's made from rigid plastic. The size is smaller when folded, yes, but it’s still big for lugging around with its needed USB-C cable and power adapter.

 This charger is better suited for a nightstand or desk. I’m not quite sure why it needs to fold, but anyone who needs to eke out as much tabletop space as possible can appreciate that aspect.

##  An Elegant, But Plastic Design

 As a statement piece, I’m a big fan of the design of the Swiv 3-in-1\. It has clean lines and a simplified aesthetic. It might look weighted, it isn't heavy at all. It’s made out of plastic with accented vegan leather material added for a soft touch feel around the folding charger.

 Personally, I would love to see a version of this charger where the pad on the left, meant for AirPods, gets chopped off. Making this a 2-in-1 charger for an iPhone and Apple Watch would make it much more compelling to add to my travel bag. Plus, AirPods can charge wirelessly on the iPhone spot if needed.

##  Charging at Full Speed

 Forgetting what this charger _could_ be, and looking at what it is, revealed a capable device. It can deliver 15W to an iPhone (and 3W to both an Apple Watch and AirPods.) It’s fully Apple-certified and uses the newer fast-charging Apple Watch standard.

 While a charging iPhone can’t show StandBy mode on a nightstand, the Apple Watch charger can be used horizontally or vertically to show off its time during the night. I tested the charger on my desk and nightstand and had no problem with it in either location.

##  Should You Buy Journey Swiv 3-in-1 Charger?

 The [Journey Swiv 3-in-1](https://journeyofficial.com/products/swiv-3-in-1-wireless-charging-station) does its job by charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at once. There’s no fault with that aspect of it. Even its layout and materials are well suited to the product it is. It’s a great Apple accessory.

 The more important consideration is _where_ you plan to use it. I think it’s a little too bulky to bring on a trip. But then, if it’s not traveling, you need to decide whether you need its space-saving folding charger. If not, there might be better options for your charging needs.
