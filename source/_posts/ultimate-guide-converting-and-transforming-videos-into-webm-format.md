## Why is WebM Important? 

A key factor in the web's success is that its core technologies such as HTML, HTTP, and TCP/IP are open and freely implementable. WebM was built for the web. By testing hundreds of thousands of videos with widely varying characteristics, we found that VP8 and VP9 deliver high-quality video while efficiently adapting to varying processing and bandwidth conditions across a broad range of devices. High-efficiency bandwidth usage and reduced storage requirements can help publishers recognize immediate cost savings. And it requires comparatively little manual tuning in the encoder to produce high-quality results. Thus converting video to WebM is the coming trends for web pages, the popularity of [WebM video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is also market demand meanwhile. 

## Why Create A New File Type (.webm)? Why Not Use .mkv?

Since WebM is a subset of MKV, it has fewer allowed stream types and features than MKV.  
 A distinct name gives us a way to easily refer to the subset, and gives users a way to associate a piece of content with a client having known-good support. Google Chrome, for example, may or may not be able to decode filename.mkv, but it will absolutely play filename.webm. Thus if you have an MKV video, you can make use of a Webm converter or [MKV video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to convert it to MKV for wilder use.
