## Cyberquad Backtracked by Tesla? Explore Other ATV Options Priced at $1,900.

It's hard to have a bad day when you're a kid riding a Tesla Cyberquad, which looks like something Batman's son would own. The only thing that might cut into your awesome childhood is being told you need to stop riding it because of a recall. But Santa will probably bring another $1,900 ATV.

[The Consumer Product Safety Commission found](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Radio-Flyer-Recalls-Cyberquad-for-Kids-Due-to-Violations-of-Federal-Safety-Standard-for-All-Terrain-Vehicles-ATVs-and-Risk-of-Injury-Sold-Exclusively-Online-by-Tesla?utm%5Fmedium=email&utm%5Fsource=govdelivery) that the Cyberquad fails to comply with federal safety standards, particularly with issues related to the mechanical suspension, maximum tire pressure, and kids probably having too much fun on it.

 In response, Radio Flyer (which built it) voluntarily issued a recall for the Cyberquad Tesla was featuring on their site. If you're one of the 5,000 or so people who purchased the Cyberquad for Kids, you can attain your full $1,900 refund by removing the motor controller and sending it back to Radio Flyer.

 Removing the motor controller permanently disables the vehicle. "Don't do it, dad," one can imagine a kid pleading. "I'll sign a waiver."

 Along with offering it on their site, Tesla consulted on the ATV's appearance, which is designed to resemble the standard Cyberquad for adults (recently announced, but not yet released). The kid version features a top speed of 10 mph and is powered by a lithium-ion battery with up to 15 miles of range, making it fantastic for running away.

 There have been no reports of any serious injuries, except for one incident when the single-rider Cyberquad tipped over after an eight-year-old child and a 36-year-old adult woman were riding it together, bruising the shoulder of the woman who didn't read the instructions.

 What's mainly been bruised is the hearts of 5,000 children. But perhaps if one of them manages to fabricate another motor controller for their deactivated Cyberquad, they'll turn out to be the next Elon Musk.
