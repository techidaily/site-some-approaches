Talking over the phone is a classic no doubt but still way too old-fashioned! Innovative technologies today allow you to talk face to face using your smartphone. Also today: recognizing documents for free, storing digital content, and fighting procrastination.

## iOS Tip: How to Use FaceTime

What is [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime)? Like [Skype](https://www.skype.com/), it’s an app and service that allows you to make video calls on iOS devices. Your calls can be routed though Wi-Fi, 3G or 4G networks. For video, [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) uses the front camera of your mobile device. You can have up to four people participating in a video call and up to nine people if you use only audio. [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) is supported on all of the Apple devices— iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers.

Before you can start using [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime), you must register with the service using your Apple ID. If you want to use [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) on your iPhone, it will automatically register your phone number as well.

![faceTime iOS video calls Skype](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26077/take-live-photos-facetime-video-calls-ios-11-protect-yourself-from-getting-recordedw1456-e1509907270398.jpg)

To call someone, you either tap their phone number or e-mail address (naturally, the other user must also must be registered with [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime)). There are several ways to place a call:

1. You can use your **Contacts**. Tap the name of the person you want to call. A [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) section will appear below the contact’s name, with two icons next to it—a video camera (initiates video calls) and a handset (for making voice calls).![iOS Face time Contacts Call from iPhone](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26078/15bbccef5d6f4dec0f5038d928d2e13e-e1509907380621.png)
2. You can also make [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) calls from **Messages**. Open your past correspondence with the person you want to call and you will see the same two icons next to his/her name.![iOS video call using Messages](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26079/07bd0fb8b9becc780e9638180d063420-e1509907479104.png)
3. Thirdly, you can tap the [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) icon while you are talking to someone over the regular phone. If the other person accepts your call, the [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) window will open and your conversion will continue there.![iOS app FaceTime how to use](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26080/b5eb985b7dcb1aefa5d822c768fc7ed9-e1509907526251.png)

The Call Waiting feature is available only during [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) voice calls. Additionally, you can:

1. End the current call and accept the incoming call.
2. Put the current call on hold and accept the incoming call.
3. Decline the incoming call.

You see that voice calls in [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) are no different to regular phone calls.

There’s not much else we could tell you about [FaceTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) apart from thanking modern technology for giving us the ability to see and speak to our near and dear who may be thousands of miles away.

## **First-Hand Experience:** Advice From a Colleague

![abbyy advice from colleague pomodoro technique](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26086/ha-n3g6i-jo-e1509908611104.jpg)

Hi,

Here’s a life hack for Monday bouts of procrastination. It’s officially called the Pomodoro technique and was invented by Francesco Cirillo. Below you can see a picture of a time piece similar to the one used by Cirillo:

![pomodoro technique against procrastination advice](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26087/762dfd30f91bb760c6eacf38818f6f5d-e1509908677143.png)

It’s a simple kitchen timer in the shape of a tomato (hence the Italian name of the technique). The method itself is a no brainer: set the timer to 25 minutes and continue working on your task until the timer rings. Twenty-five minutes is not that much, is it? Then take a short break (say, 5 minutes) and do another 25-minute stint. After three pomodoros you are entitled to a bigger break of 25-30 minutes.

When you actually start timing yourself, the method might prove harder to follow than it looks on paper, but don’t despair. Try again, and your next pomodoro will most likely be 25 minutes of honest work.

That’s all for today, guys. See you next Monday! P.S. You can find the previous issue of this newsletter [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/).
