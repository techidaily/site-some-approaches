## Part 5\. Best VivaVideo App Alternative On Desktop

Although mobile video editing apps can be worth trying, desktop software is still more advantageous. Some most notable benefits of using desktop video editors over their mobile counterparts are the following:

**More Features:** Desktop video editors usually have more features than most mobile editing apps. This means that you can do more with your videos, such as adding special effects, transitions, and titles.

**Greater Control:** With a desktop video editor, you have greater control over the final product. This is because you can fine-tune every video aspect, from the frame rate to the audio levels.

**Easier To Use:** Desktop video editors are typically more straightforward to use than mobile apps. This is because they have a larger screen to work on and a more robust interface.

Thus, if you're looking for a powerful and easy-to-use video editing app, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is a great option. The software comes with numerous features, such as a library of royalty-free music, video effects, and titles. You can also use Filmora to create slow-mo or fast-mo videos.
