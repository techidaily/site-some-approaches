### 2.SEO techniques

Several SEO techniques can help to increase the number of subscribers to your Google podcast:

##### Keywords

Use relevant keywords in your podcast title, description, and tags. When you use relevant keywords, people can find your content easily while searching for a specific topic.

##### Create transcripts

Having a podcast transcript can help search engines understand the content of your podcast. As a result, it will eventually increase its visibility in search results.

##### Promote on social media

Share your podcast on social media platforms and encourage your audience to share it with their networks. It can increase your visibility and attract more subscribers.

##### Engage

Encourage your listeners to leave ratings and reviews on your podcast. It can help to increase its visibility in search results.

By implementing these SEO techniques, you can increase the number of subscribers to your Google podcast and reach a wider audience.

### 3.A fancy cover matters

The first thing that will attract listeners is your podcast's cover art. It can improve the credibility of your podcast and encourage listeners to give it a try. It is just like how a movie or a book with good cover art seems more appealing.

Regardless of what platform you are uploading your podcast on. The cover cart is the key to standing out from the crowd. Unfortunately, different platforms have their own size specifications for cover art. Let's see the requirements for Google Podcasts:

* Size: 3000 x 3000 pixels (1400 x 1400 pixels minimum)
