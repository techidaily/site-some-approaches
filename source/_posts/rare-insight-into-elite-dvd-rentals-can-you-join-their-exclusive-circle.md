Here are 4 key criteria you can proceed with.

**DVD Rental Site Service:** some sites support to online rent DVD movies by mail; some rent DVD movies via free double-way shipping, plus kiosks to auto rent DVD movies near your local drug store or grocery store.

**Plan & Pricing:** the popular sites to rent DVDs also differ from each other in plan & pricing. For instance, Redbox rents DVD movies at per rental in timely fashion; Cafe DVD offers users two plans: pay per rental and monthly subscription; Netflix only has monthly subscription so far.

## Top Online DVD Rental Sites to Rent DVD Movies Easily & Fast

Based on the above mentioned 4 criteria, we pick out the top sites for your reference if you have the need to rent DVD movies online. What's more, we also list out their pros and cons for your overall judgement. Just opt for the one that suits you best.

### RedBox

Specifically speaking, Redbox is not a purely online site for DVD rental. On one hand, it provides you with the online service for finding Redbox kiosks and seaching for your desired DVD & Blu-ray discs information. On the other hand, its Redbox kiosks near your local drug stores or grocery stores are the destination place for you to rent DVD discs. You can directly rent DVD & Blu-ray discs without mail or shipping. Fast and convenient!

**Plan & Pricing:**

Daily rental charge: DVDs priced at $1 per day & Blu-ray at $1.5, both plus applicable tax. If you keep [Redbox DVD rental](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for the maximum rental period (currently 17 days for movies), you'll be charged at maximum charge and you have the ownership of the disc.

 **Pros:**

1\. Rent DVD disc fast, no shipping time.

2\. Daily rental charge, more flexible than monthly subscription.

3\. Renters can return DVD rentals to any Redbox kiosk.

### Netflix

Can't find the latest movie on DVD rental site Redbox? Go Netflix to search it from [best movies on Netflix](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). It not only includes an expansive library of movies, but also HBO Game of Throne season 7 TV series. And amazingly, it can guarantee 90% subscribers to receive DVD rentals via 1-day service attributing to its 40+ distribution centers across USA. Also you can stream Netflix movies to iPhone iPad, Android, smart TV, Mac, etc.

### Blockbuster DVD Rentals

The Blockbuster online DVD rental site claims that the movies and TV shows its On Demand service offers are almost 28 days earlier than RedBox rentals. That means if you can't rent the latest movies or TV shows on RedBox or Netflix, Blockbuster is the [best alternative to Netflix](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and Redbox for you to access to your much-anticipated movies. Plus, it even provides more charging plans for you to choose from.

### CafeDVD

Personally, I would give a thumb down to webpage design of this online site to rent discs. It's really ugly, the small yet crowded words, the centralized sections, unattractive color matching, etc. Obviously, that's the big part it needs to improve. Of course, it still has something good, like its primary feature - DVD rental service. As its ads show, it offers you with over 60,000 titles from old movies to new releases. No matter where you live, you can receive the rental DVDs as long as your place has First Class Mail in the USA. 

**Plan & Pricing:** 

Pay per rental: $3 per DVD for 8 days of rental period. $3.49 for most Blu-ray. (shipping fees not included)  
 Monthly subscription: $11.99 per month up to 6 DVDs (2 DVDs at a time); $21.99/M up to 12 DVDs (4 DVDs at a time). (shipping cost included)

 **Pros:**

1\. Both pay per rental and monthly subscription available on this online DVD rental service.

2\. $5 off for new subscription membership.

 **Cons:** 

1\. Ugly webpage design.

2\. No online movie streaming service.
