## Experiencing Next-Level Audio with the Anker SoundCore Motion X6# - In-Depth Review of the Revolutionary Spatial Speaker

### Key Takeaways

* Excellent spatial audio reproduction (wide soundstage), gives added depth to your favorite music.
* Portable and water resistant, allowing you to take the speaker with you to most places.
* Big, full sound for a decently compact speaker, providing a satisfying listening experience.

 Spatial audio music isn’t a gimmick, but not a lot of people have really experienced it out loud. Sonos Era 300 is one option, but now the [Soundcore Motion X600](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.soundcore.com%2Fproducts%2Fmotion-x600-early-discounts) Bluetooth speaker is another spatial audio speaker, and it’s highly impressive, not to mention portable.

##  A New Type of Spatial Audio Speaker

![buttons on the top of the anker soundcore motion x600](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/buttons-on-the-top-of-the-anker-soundcore-motion-x600jpg_52862605623_o.jpg)

 I’ll try not to crib too much from my review of the [Sonos Era 300 Wi-Fi speaker](https://web.archive.org/web/20230608045130/https://www.reviewgeek.com/148845/sonos-era-300-review/), but that speaker really requires buying into and playing spatial audio music. Because the Motion X600 retails for a fraction of the Era 300, you don't necessarily have to go all in on listening to spatial audio—though it is still a key part of this speaker.

 The Motion X600 speaker uses a 5-driver speaker array to play back Dolby Atmos songs and makes it seem that sound is coming from a much larger speaker than it actually is. One of those drivers is up-firing, which is important for a more convincing spatial experience.

 I really liked that this Soundcore speaker included a button right on top to turn off the spatial audio speaker array. Personally, I didn’t find myself reaching for that button often except to demo the differences between stereo sound and spatial audio. That on-and-off button was super helpful for the A-B testing.

 Personally, I’m all in on spatial audio. I don’t need music to swirl around me, and most songs won’t do that, but there is much more depth and clarity in songs mixed for Dolby Atmos. This speaker opens even more places to have that better, spatial, listening experience.

##  The Sound of the Soundcore Motion X600 Speaker

[Apple Music on iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390?at=1010l392g&ct=rg152827) and [Android](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=14d03d76e0a6285761e58439513dfd19&u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.apple.android.music%26hl%3Den%5FUS%26gl%3DUS&cuid=xid:fr1686199891aab) supports streaming its Dolby Atmos songs over Bluetooth. This is true of wireless headphones as well as this Motion X600 speaker. Amazon Music and Tidal also have spatial audio mixes available, if you subscribe to one of those services.

 If you don’t subscribe to one of those streaming services or listen to non-spatially mixed songs, the music still sounds great from the speaker. I found stereo-mixed songs didn’t sound weird, either. The speaker handled the different formats with a lot of grace.

 Overall, the music sounded full, crisp, and accurate on the speaker. Across all genres, music was pleasant to listen to. Of course, there were reasonable limitations to what the Soundcore Motion X600 speaker could do. If needed, it could get loud enough with 50W of power to fill a common living room. I found it sounded the best when it was closer to a 30-50% volume level, indoors. The drivers didn’t sound stressed at that level, but it was still able to push out plenty of overall ambiance.

 Throughout it all, the mid-range was clean and clear. The vocals were audible and strumming guitars were distinct. There was generally enough low-end bass to provide a thump, especially compared to the speaker’s size.

![charging the anker soundcore motion x600 with a usb-c cable](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/charging-the-anker-soundcore-motion-x600-with-a-usb-c-cablejpg_52862333239_o.jpg)

 With a permanent handle and an IPX7 waterproof rating, the Motion X600 speaker is fine to travel outside. Listening to music outside still sounded great too. Without walls to bounce off of, there was much less distinction between spatially mixed songs than stereo-mixed ones. The depth was still present and sounded good, but the spatial-ness thrives more with walls around it.

 Turning the volume up to around 60% in my backyard yielded a solid sound. Pumping up the volume past 80% really stressed the drivers and the music suffered, but the Motion X600 could do it if you want it to.

##  Additional Benefits of the Motion X600 Bluetooth Speaker

 At the time of testing, the Motion X600 speaker was supported in the Soundcore app (available for [iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/soundcore/id1331876603?at=1010l392g&ct=rg152827) and [Android](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=14d03d76e0a6285761e58439513dfd19&u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.oceanwing.soundcore%26hl%3Den%5FUS%26gl%3DUS&cuid=xid:fr1686199891aac)) but did not support turning on or off the spatial setting remotely. EQ for the speaker could be adjusted through the app, the "Bass Up" button could be toggled remotely, and the speaker could even be shut off through the app, but there was no awareness of the speaker’s spatial sound.

 It would be great if the app were updated to engage spatial audio remotely. Even better, it would be great if there were EQ settings for spatial audio aimed at different-sized rooms. The app was only fine, but it was about on par with a bulk of other Bluetooth speakers. The software wasn’t a deal breaker because I mostly forgot it existed.

 On the back of the Motion X600 is an aux input to connect a non-wireless playback device. I connected an Audio Technica turntable as an experiment, and it worked. It’s not how I would recommend using the speaker or the turntable, but it did work without any hiss or distortion.

 If you’re in the market for a small to mid-sized portable Bluetooth speaker, the [Anker Soundcore Motion X600](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Portable-Bluetooth-Wireless-Waterproof/dp/B0BWXM3RRK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001053&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fanker-soundcore-motion-x600-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is the one to buy, unequivocally. It gets loud enough, and the music sounds good enough to justify its $200 retail price. But even better, the spatial audio reproduction sounds great, it’s also essentially waterproof and has an aux input for miscellaneous devices.

 Of course, there are plenty of needs that might fall outside of those considerations, and so it might not be the [perfect speaker for everyone](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-photo-perfection-highest-rated-phone-tripods/). But after spending some time with the Motion X600, it’s hard to beat for a lot of uses.
