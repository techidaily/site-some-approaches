## Bonus. Common Errors in MP4 Video Conversion

Honestly, I'm strongly shocked by the errors of video to MP4 conversion when I find hundreds of threads posted by users in forums including macrumors, videohelp, mac-forums, etc. Most of users choose Handbrake or Any Video Converter Free to free convert videos from MKV to MP4, AVI to MP4, MPEG to MP4, MP4 to DVD, and more, either on MacBook or iMac. However, different hardware configurations and input formats end up with the same result: failure, even when you choose the same output format MP4\. Hard to imagine there are so many issues in video to MP4 conversion process. Here gathers the most common errors in video conversion to MP4\. Check if they are familiar to you.

convert video to MP4 errors

1. Some free MP4 video converter for Mac programs would apply watermark to output MP4 files and even make the video bad quality when converted.
2. DakotaPaul says he's using Handbrake to convert MKV to MP4, but Handbrake stops encoding halfway; only 40-min video being converted.
3. When it comes to convert WMV to MP4 on Mac free with Handbrake, users encounter the problem of **"Handbrake gets all videos stripped, only audio left"**.
4. Any Video Converter Free generates an intact MP4 files, with subtitles missing in the middle of video.
5. Feedback from tkmops indicates that there is a **black rectangle super areas** imposed over the bottom right corner of MP4 files after using Handbrake to convert.
6. A user named javilionaire complains on the forums.macrumors that MP4Box converts 720p MKV to 720p MP4 with endless "demux", "remux" such stuff.
7. Other issues cover video audio out of sync after AVI to MP4 conversion, the picture is interlaced after converting AVCHD to MP4, picture size of MP4 all wrong, etc.
8. When it comes to convert MP4 to MP3 with VLC player, users change the bitrate or the sampling frequency and can't save file into mp3, but only into .raw, .ps, .ts.

Certainly, until now, you might be more interested in the reasons why these errors would happen rather than these phenomena. The reasons are complex. Perhaps it's the video file itself to be blame or the outside elements like free MP4 video converter Mac software, hardware configurations, improper operation, the plugin interference, etc. to shoulder the responsibility. So, if you encounter such errors next time, you can try to think the potential reasons from these sides and then figure out the solutions first by yourself. We can't render you a lot help in every side, but what we can provide you are some useful suggestions on free MP4 converter for Mac for your reference, which at least can help you solve certain video to MP4 and MP4 to video/audio conversion errors, if not all.
