## 1. Stay Updated: Essential Software Patches and Features Now Available on Your Apple Devices

Apple rolled out a minor update for iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and other devices [back in March](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-proven-techniques-to-swell-your-social-media-following/), with new emoji and new features for web apps. There's now another upgrade rolling out.

 First up is iOS 16.5, which is now available for supported iPhone models. It includes a new sports tab in Apple News, as well as My Sports score and schedule cards. There's also a new Pride Celebration wallpaper for the Lock Screen, since we're only a few days away from the start of [LGBTQ+ Pride Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride%5FMonth). Apple announced a new Pride Edition Sport Band for the Apple Watch [earlier this month](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-watch-pride-edition-celebrates-the-lgbtq-community/), which matches the wallpaper in this update.
