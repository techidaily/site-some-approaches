### Key Takeaways

* GaN chargers based on gallium nitride are more compact, energy-efficient, and charge devices faster than traditional silicon chargers.
* The ACEFAST GaN PD65W Portable Dock is a small and lightweight 3-in-1 dock with a USB-C port, USB-A port, and HDMI output that supports up to a 4K display.
* The ACEFAST dock is compatible with various USB-C devices. However, compatibility with the HDMI feature may vary for different devices.

 There's a reason why you see GaN chargers everywhere. Because they're based around [gallium nitride](https://gansystems.com/gallium-nitride-semiconductor/), rather than silicon, they can be more compact and energy efficient, as well as charge supported devices faster. While it's clear that GaN chargers are the way to go for today's devices, these small bricks typically only provide power. This means you need to find another way to output to an external display. Enter the [ACEFAST GaN PD65W Portable Dock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09W5T391Z/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000616&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Facefast-gan-pd65w-portable-dock-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate).

 The ACEFAST GaN PD65W answers the question, "What would happen if you simplify things and take the dock out the dock?" In short, would its streamlined capabilities be offset by its more portable nature and greater compatibility versus a more feature-rich, but device-specific dock? Let's find out.

ACEFAST GaN PD65W Portable Dock

 In the box, you get the GaN charger with a foldable two-prong AC plug, 5.9ft USB-C to USB-C data / fast charge braided aluminum alloy cable, and a quick start guide. The ACEFAST GaN PD65W is impressively small and light at just 2.36 x 1.24 x 2.04in and 4.69oz, both less than you'd find in some traditional GaN chargers.

 Larger and device-specific docks, like Nintendo's [Switch Dock](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/dock-oled-model-black-116470/) and Valve's [Steam Deck Docking Station](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock), offer multiple USB ports and sometimes multi-display capabilities and Ethernet. The ACEFAST GaN PD65W is a more streamlined 3-in-1, with a USB-C 3.1 60W Max port, USB-A 3.0 5V/1A Max port, and a full-size HDMI output that can support up to a 3840 x 2160/60Hz 4K display.

 While you can use the ACEFAST GaN PD65W as a regular charger, if you have a device that supports power and display over USB-C, it suddenly transforms into something twice as useful. Compatible devices include Nintendo Switch, Valve Steam Deck, Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets, Apple MacBooks, Apple iPhones and iPads, Google Chromebooks, Google Pixel series, Microsoft Surface laptops, PC laptops, and more. The list of USB-C-based devices, especially those that support power and display over a single cable continues to grow.

##  Performance Tests: It (Mostly) Just Works

ACEFAST GaN PD65W Portable Dock

 The USB-C 3.1 60W port supports Apple 2.4A, Samsung 5V-2A, Samsung AFC, QC 2.0 - 40+, PD 3.0, and PPS multiple charging protocols. That same port can support simultaneous charging speeds of up to 20V/5A and high-speed data transfer of up to 10Gbps. Of course, you'll need to use a [full-featured USB-C cable](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), like the one included, to support both power and data.

 For a display, I used an [INNOCN Ultrawide monitor](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-phone-without-google-account-by-drfone-android/) connected to the ACEFAST's HDMI port, although I did use other displays for more complete compatibility testing. For the systems that support a mouse and keyboard, I connected a [Logitech K400r](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-920-003110-Touch-Keyboard-K400/dp/B005DVQZM8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000616&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Facefast-gan-pd65w-portable-dock-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) using its wireless USB dongle connected to the ACEFAST's USB-A port.

 I tested across a variety of older and newer devices, including a Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch OLED, Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+, Asus Chromebook CX1, Microsoft Surface Book 3, and Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen).

###  Steam Deck

 Once connected over USB-C, the Steam Deck disabled its internal display. Although impractical for the gaming handheld's capabilities, it was able to drive the external display at 3,440 x 1,440 @ 60Hz while still charging. Of course, just about every other resolution was supported, including the Steam Deck's native 1,280 x 800 at 60Hz. The keyboard and trackpad worked perfectly, as did the Steam Deck's onboard controls and external Bluetooth game controller.

###  Nintendo Switch OLED

 Like the Steam Deck, once connected, the Switch disabled its internal display. By design, when the Switch is docked, attached Joy-Con controllers are disabled. You either need to slide the Joy-Cons off to use them as wireless controllers or use another type of external controller. The nice thing with the ACEFAST is that you can also connect a compatible controller to its USB-A port and the Switch will immediately recognize it, which is what it did in the case of the generic third-party controller I tried.

###  Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+

 Once connected over USB-C, the Galaxy Tab S7+ mirrored the display and entered its desktop-like computing mode, [DeX](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/earning-strategies-for-successful-youtube-shorts-what-you-need-and-how-much-in-2024/). The keyboard and trackpad worked right away as well. In fact, even the USB-based controller I tried on the Switch via the dock also worked on the S7+.

###  ASUS CX1400CN Chromebook

 The [Asus Chromebook CX1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B098KSXTFH/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000616&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Facefast-gan-pd65w-portable-dock-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) didn't recognize the display at all. The laptop was, however, able to charge over USB-C.

###  Microsoft Surface Book 3

 The Microsoft Surface Book 3 was able to both mirror and extend its display without issue, as well as use the external Logitech K400r. I also tested with the [AVA WirelessHD portable monitor](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ava-4k-wirelesshd-next-gen-touch-monitor/x/1463963#/)'s ThunderBolt 3 USB-C port for video and audio, which similarly worked well. However, the AVA's touchscreen functionality did not work when connected through the ACEFAST dock.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen)

 The Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen) was able to connect to the display, charge, and use the Logitech K400r as a mouse pointer and keyboard. However, the display connection seemed unstable after a few minutes, as the monitor would lose sync with the iPad and flash the screen every 10 to 15 seconds.

 Hot swapping the USB-C cable between devices could also sometimes cause the display to lose sync and flash. In fact, early on in testing, even without hot swapping, there was a flashing display issue across almost all devices. Even trying different cables didn't help. This issue eventually resolved on its own without further intervention and I've enjoyed stable charging, USB device, and external display usage since. Of course, testing with the Asus Chromebook CX1 and Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen) never produced better results.

 Finally, it's important to note that the ACEFAST GaN PD65W does tend to run quite warm. This is not unusual for a GaN charger and the ACEFAST never gets uncomfortably hot.

##  Should You Buy the ACEFAST GaN PD65W Portable Dock?

ACEFAST GaN PD65W Portable Dock

 The ACEFAST GaN PD65W is a simple product that delivers on its promises. It's a broadly compatible and compact USB-C-based charging dock that offers a USB-A port and HDMI output.

 Although not as feature-rich as some larger or product-specific docks, what you gain in convenience with compatible devices may offset any of its limitations. Of course, even USB-C-based devices can be finicky at times, especially when combining charging, external device connections, and an external display over a single connection. As testing showed, not every device that should be compatible worked well with the ACEFAST's HDMI feature.

 Overall, the ACEFAST's targeted feature set and portability make it an excellent primary or secondary travel dock, especially as the ecosystem of compatible USB-C-based devices continues to grow.
