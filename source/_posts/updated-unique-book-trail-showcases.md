## Part 3\. Ideas for a book trailer

Here are some great ideas to make your book trailer more outstanding.

### 1\. Introduce the Synopsis

You can excitingly introduce the book's synopsis to attract the readers. Try to take the combination of reality and fiction. The so-called virtual mainly refers to the omission of those secondary plot and characters to give the audience imagination and foreshadowing to cause the audience's expectations and illusions, thereby increasing the audience's suspense. The term "real" primarily refers to the central theme of the original movie, the protagonists, and significant elements of the particular performance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Keep it short

A short book trailer is more viewed than a longer one. So, always try to make your book trailer quick.

### 3\. Narrate the story

It is one of the best ideas to narrate the story as it will make the trailer more interesting to watch. Remember to maintain some suspense if the book you are presenting is a novel. Give a brief summary of the plot to encourage readers to keep reading to discover the solution.

### 4\. Well structure

A good book trailer should be well structured and follow a concise and exciting frame structure. In fact, it is comparable to standard movie trailers in that its primary purpose is to advertise a work to draw viewers to it or to introduce the viewer to the author's creative concept or background. For creation, you can therefore also take inspiration from the typical format of movie trailers.
