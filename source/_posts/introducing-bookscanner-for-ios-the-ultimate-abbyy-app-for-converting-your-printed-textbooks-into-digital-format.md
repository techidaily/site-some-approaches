Rainy November is our favorite time to curl up with a book, all cozy by a fireplace, and enjoy a quiet evening. It’s also the month of Thanksgiving, and we have a lot of cooking, celebrating and gift giving to look forward to. But for some of us it’s also the time of hard work at school, university or at the office – the deadlines of annual reports and budgets are approaching fast. Papers, spreadsheets, lectures, notes and books are all around us, some of them we enjoy in our free time, some are great helpers in our studies, research and work. Whatever it might be, there is a new way to get more out of the books in your life, to use and manage the vast amounts of information they contain in the most efficient way possible.

With our new app [BookScanner](http://qrs.ly/bk5dljh), you don’t have to carry books with you everywhere. You can scan and digitize them, recognize the text, make it searchable and editable, save and share it. [BookScanner](http://qrs.ly/bk5dljh) will create high-quality digital copies of your favorite books.

[BookScanner’s](http://qrs.ly/bk5dljh)exclusive technology is the result of over 2 years of intensive R&D. The app recognizes facing book pages on photos and splits them into two separate images, each containing a single page. It also automatically corrects curved lines on the page, removes optical distortions, and repairs lighting defects. Book scanning has never been so easy. You can also use filters: grayscale, color and black-and-white.

A digital copy can be converted to an FB2 or EPUB formats and read right on your device. All you have to do is take a photo and send it to recognition, choose the correct languages and formats.[BookScanner](http://qrs.ly/bk5dljh)understands 193 languages (including Cyrillic, Latin, and CJK) and converts scans into 12 formats (including DOCX, PDF, EPUB and FB2) preserving the original document structure. Very convenient for students, professors, researchers, and lawyers – everyone who works with books and enjoys reading.

In addition to books, [BookScanner](http://qrs.ly/bk5dljh) can scan documents: agreements, bills, reports, presentation and more.

Share your scans with classmates or colleagues easily using email, iMessage, cloud storages (iCloud, Box, Yandex.Disk, Evernote, Dropbox) or iTunes Sharing. The app also has internal storage with tags and search capabilities, so you can find the right book quickly.

Now all the books are in your smartphone: safe, organized and easily accessible. Not only is your bag lighter, but you are less stressed out as well. For example, I don’t have to worry about returning library books on time – just scan and go!

Get [BookScanner](http://qrs.ly/bk5dljh) on the AppStore and try it out for yourself! You can also leave a comment or a question for the developers there.

Good luck, be safe and have a wonderful Thanksgiving!
