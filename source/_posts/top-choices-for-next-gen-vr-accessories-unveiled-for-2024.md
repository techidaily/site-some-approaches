* Mogo Pro Controller

 It is a very famous VR controller gamepad which is compatible with iOS, android and also windows phone. It is very comfortable for the long play sessions. A very long battery life and also rubberized grips make it even more special. It has a retail average price $49.99\. It is available online and in high street retail.

* Gamesir G3S

 This controller is not well known in this industry. But it is a very respectable Bluetooth controller gamepad for many VR products and games. It also has a very good battery life. It has an average retail price of $47.99 and it is easily available online.

## 2\. VR Bikes

 Virtual reality can help you to enjoy the best biking experience of your life. Here are some of the products you might want to experience once.

* VirZoom

 The VirZoom has a unique apartment-friendly magnitude, but it still priced at $399.95 only, on balance with some other home fitness apparatuses. Along with a headset and also a computer capable of using it, however, that ticket could be as costly as $1500\. That is a very big asset for the customers whose Wii Fit is more likely gathering dirt at the house of their parents. Fortunately, Honey man says a gymnasium form of VirZoom will also be ready in the year 2017.

* Widerun virtual biking

 Visualize yourself biking in the city of San Francisco in the bay, on the Olympic racing track as well, and on the snowy trail on the Alps, and in any city as well around the world! You will surely be reluctant to get off the bike is you can bike in these cool sites virtually! This is the virtual reality and the augmented reality in its best form! Good work was done by Widerun!
