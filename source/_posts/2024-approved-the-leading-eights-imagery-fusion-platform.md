## The Leading Eight’s Imagery Fusion Platform

Photomontages are a powerful way to convey your message visually. By combining a series of photographs in a specific order, photo montages create a certain mood, incite emotion, or tell a story in a single artwork. A video montage is often used for valentine's days, memorials, birthday parties, wedding anniversaries, or anything worth remembering.
