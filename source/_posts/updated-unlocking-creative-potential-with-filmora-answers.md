## Question 2: Video editing skills

![questions from audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-7.png)

The best way to make a string disappear in your video is masking. Here is how you can use this feature to remove something from your clip. Follow the steps explained below.

##### Step1 Record the footage

First, record your shot from a slightly lower angle if the string is tied from above. Ensure the object to which the string is tied is not visible in the footage.

![record your clip from a slightly lower angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-8.gif)

Remove the object and string from the shot and record the background for about 10 seconds.

![record empty background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-9.jpg)

##### Step2 Video editing

Now, launch the video editing software Wondershare Filmora. Drag and drop your empty background clip on the first video track.

![import clip with empty background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-10.gif)

Now drag the other clip with the object and string on the second video track.

![choose and select the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-12.gif)

Move the mask around until the string is in the mask box.

![move the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-13.gif)

Then in the mask tab, click on the invert mask option. You can play around with these tabs to clean up the mask to refine the shot.

![questions from the audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-17.jpg)

First of all, you need to purchase a good mic. A good mic can enhance the quality of your audio and make it much more transparent. But sometimes there is too much background noise, and you cannot control it. So I will show you how to reduce background noise step by step using Wondershare Filmora.

### Steps for reducing background noise

Step1 Launch Wonderhsare Filmora and import your clip into it.

![launch filmora and import clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-18.png)

Step2 Double-click the clip you want to denoise. And click the audio at the top.

![click audio at the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-19.png)

Step3 Now select the denoise button and choose between weak, medium, and strong intensity to remove background noises.

![select denoise button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-20.gif)

You can also use the equalizer to remove background noises and improve your audio manually. The steps you have to follow are given below.

* Follow the same steps as explained above till step 3.
* Choose the customize option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![choose the customise option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-21.png)

The first three dials of the equalizer usually control the bass, and these dials are mainly used to remove any background noise. The dials in the middle control the mid-tones. Finally, the last dials control the high pitch sounds.

![first three dials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-22.png)

Step4 Start moving dials up and down and find the right balance for your clip.

![questions from audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-26.png)

It is a great question. You might have noticed a crown icon next to some features in Filmora. It is for specific editing features accessible to users only with a Filmora license.

These features include 4K video export, keyframing, speed ramping, and many more. Purchase a Filmora license from their official website and enjoy these beautiful features.

## Question 5: Filmora purchase

![will next versions of filmora be valid on the lifetime license](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-27.png)

If you bought Filmora 9 lifetime license years ago, you can upgrade to Filmora X and use the same license. However, since Filmora X, there is no lifetime license anymore. Instead, a perpetual license is made for a specific version of Filmora. It includes minor updates continually with payment of a single fee, but for major upgrades, like Filmora 11 to Filmora 12, there will be an additional fee. Therefore, the answer is no.
