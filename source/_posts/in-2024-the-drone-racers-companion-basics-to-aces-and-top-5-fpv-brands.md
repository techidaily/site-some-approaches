## What is drone racing

Drone racing is a process designed to focus on racing small or large FPV drones on a selected course. The primary focus here is to create fast and very powerful multi-rotors that can deliver incredible speed. The idea is to keep the drone as light as possible because if the drone is heavy you will lose speed and momentum, which is something you want to avoid. Drone racing is so popular at this time that there are many tournaments all over the globe. Obviously, you can also try to enter the drone racing world, which is why opting for some of the best racing drones can be a very good idea!

## To build or to buy

You need to figure out if you will buy the best racing drones or if you will build them on your own. These are the two options you want to focus on and each one of them comes with a different set of features. Well, it mostly depends on what you want to do with that drone and the value that you expect from it. Some of the drones are known to be very fast, others not so much. A ready-to-fly model will allow you to spend less time since you just get the drone and you go training.

On the other hand, if you buy parts like the motor frame, propellers and motors you can easily build FPV drones on your own. You can expect the process to be very time-consuming and that's obviously something to keep in mind. But on the other hand, being able to build your own FPV drones does mean you can focus on creating something lightweight and with a very good speed. It certainly manages to bring in front a delightful experience and one of the best that you can find out there. Should you build a good drone of your own? If you want it solely for drone racing then yes, this can be a very good idea. You just have to take your time, study all the options, and then focus on what gives you the most value. Sure, there are plenty of challenges in this situation, but if you focus on quality first and foremost, nothing is impossible.
