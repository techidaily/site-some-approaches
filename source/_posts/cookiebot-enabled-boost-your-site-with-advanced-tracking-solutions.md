Pierre’s interest in sports began at a young age, with a particular love for tennis. "I remember going to visit friends and bringing a bag of sporting equipment with me," he recalls. In high school, his focus shifted to track and field, specifically the shot-put, which introduced him to weight training. Inspired by a picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Pierre decided to build a strong, powerful, and functional body, and his journey in bodybuilding began. "The rest is history!"

##### What is special about this hobby to you?

When asked this question, Pierre was quick to correct us “bodybuilding is not just a hobby, but a lifestyle!”. His daily routine involves careful meal planning, hydration, and rigorous gym sessions. What makes bodybuilding special to him is the direct correlation between effort and results. "It is incredibly rewarding, even after doing this for over 30 years," he says, appreciating the strength, health, and energy it brings to his life.

##### Do you feel like having this specific passion helps you achieve a better work-life balance? If yes, in what ways?

"Absolutely!" Pierre finds that intense workdays are balanced by the stress-relief provided by his workouts. This allows him to return to work the next day refreshed and energized, not only maintaining but enhancing his productivity and vitality for other activities as well.

##### Are there any skills you developed in your fitness journey that are transferable to your work at ABBYY, or any learnings that you can apply in your day job?

Bodybuilding has taught Pierre valuable lessons in discipline and consistency. "There really are no secrets, you show up and do the work!" He also highlights how the sport teaches perseverance through challenging tasks and fosters a sense of community and mentorship. These skills translate well into his professional life, helping him approach work with the same dedication and willingness to share knowledge.
