So, which one is better? Magix Music Maker or [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/)? To answer this question, we've provided a quick verdict below:

### Verdict

Magix Music Maker is a great entry-level DAW but lacks the features and depth that FL studio offers. The latter includes more advanced features, mixing tools, and a synthesizer for music production, making music sound more professional.

* 8.8 for meets requirements
* 8.7 for ease of use
* 8.1 for ease of setup
* 8.3 for ease of admin
* 8.2 for the quality of support

On the other hand, Magix Music Maker 2023 is rated as:

* 9.0 for meets requirements
