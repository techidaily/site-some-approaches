### More info for AVI and HEVC Format 

**[AVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High%5FEfficiency%5FVideo%5FCoding)**: AVI, short for Audio Video Interleaved, is a container format to contain videos and audios. It was introduced by Microsoft in 1992 for Windows Operating System. Most Windows devices support AVI format. AVI supports various video codecs, covering MPEG 1, MPEG 2, MPEG 4 (Xvid, DivX) and more.

**[HEVC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)**: High-Efficiency Video Coding, also H.265 and MPEG-4 Part 2, is a successor to AVC (H.264) video codec. [H.265 vs H.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), it offers twice the data compression ratio at the same video quality. It supports 4K and even 8K UHD. 

**Possible Reasons Why We Decode AVI Files to HEVC**

* iPhone, iPad, macOS, iMovie, iTunes and other Apple devices and apps don't accept AVI video files.
* AVI files with some certain codecs cannot play without the same codec installed.
* Uncompressed AVI files can have very large file size.
