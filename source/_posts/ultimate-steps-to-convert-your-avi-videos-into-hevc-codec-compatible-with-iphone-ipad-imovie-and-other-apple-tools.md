## How to Convert AVI to HEVC/H.265 for iPhone, iPad, Apple Apps etc.

**Step 1: Add source video**  
Open the program on your computer. Click Video icon at the top and the program will ask you to select source video to transcode. You can select one or more AVI video files at a time. Or you can directly drag and drop source video to the main interface and the video will be loaded quickly. MacX Video Converter Pro can import and output almost any kind of video files, such as MP4, MKV, AVCHD, MTS, M2TS, WMV, FLV, MOV, H.265, VP9, H.264, and many more. So you can transcode [H.265 to H.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), [MKV to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), [WMV to MOV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), FLV to MP4, to name a few. 

**Step 2: Choose output format**  
After the source video is loaded, the Output Profile window will appear. Click Mac General Video on the left and select "MP4 Video (HEVC)" on the popping-up list to [convert AVI to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) with HEVC codec, and click Done to save the settings. We recommend you to use MP4 container format for HEVC because of its good compatibility.
