### 4\. Attractive voice

It would be more awesome if you made a podcast trailer with a narrator's voice. You can narrate the central theme or idea of the podcast.

Filmora will automatically add the audio visualizing effect to match the sound in your film when you drag and drop. You can design up to 25 different types of audiovisual effects to best suit your movie. By automatically matching your video sound to make it come alive, the audio visualizing effect will make your movie more compelling.
