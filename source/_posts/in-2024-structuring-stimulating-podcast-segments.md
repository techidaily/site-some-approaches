### 4\. Attractive voice

It would be more awesome if you made a podcast trailer with a narrator's voice. You can narrate the central theme or idea of the podcast.

### 5\. Make it interesting for each episode

Each podcast has a unique theme, so it's best to have each one its trailer. But the thing to remember here is that don't use the same intro or lines every time. You have to be unique in every podcast trailer episode. Otherwise, the audience will lose interest in your trailers.

It auto decrease and increase the background or other sounds to make the audio clear and enhanced. This is highly helpful in creating any podcast, vlog, etc.

### Silence Detection

As we know, the silent spots in audio distract the listener. Therefore, it is better to get rid of them, but it isn't an easy task for you, especially if you are a beginner in editing. But Wondershare Filmora's Silence Detection is an essential feature as it can help you in auto removing the silent parts of your audio based on your settings. You can clear unwanted audio parts quickly and achieve high-quality audio editing with a simple click.

### Audio Visualizer

If you have no suitable video clips to add to your radio drama, but you don't want your trailer to look so monotonous, an audio visualizer must be perfect for you. Filmora will automatically add the audio visualizing effect to match the sound in your film when you drag and drop. You can design up to 25 different types of audiovisual effects to best suit your movie. By automatically matching your video sound to make it come alive, the audio visualizing effect will make your movie more compelling.
