## How iPhone Has Been Changed? From Steve Jobs to Tim Cook

The term "innovation" or "reinvention" has long been a cliché in tech companies. But there's nothing exaggerated when Steve Jobs tried to "reinvent the phone" 10 years ago. It set the standard for mobile devices we haven't seen before. 10 years later when Time Cook teased "The best is yet to come", we cannot help but look forward to the new gadget. Before we go deep into iPhone, let's take a quick look at the two leaders in iPhone evolution.

Steve Jobs

“ Those who are crazy enough to think  
they can change the world usually do. ”

The history of iPhone started from the visionary genius Steve Jobs. Seen as an icon of perfectionism and innovation, Jobs is obsessed with the user experience and focuses the product itself than its profits, who accordingly created the 3-in-1 "Jesus Phone" that changed the smartphone market. But company under Jobs was a financial and operational mess. 

Tim Cook

“ Apple has a culture of excellence that is.  
I'm not going to witness or permit the change of it. ”

If Apple's innovation was down to Steve Job then its sales and revenue increase hinges on Tim Cook. Under Cook's leadership, more than 10 billion iPhones has been sold, 87% of which has been sold during Tim Cook's time. He emphasizes on teamwork, users demands and market competition. But he is less-innovative and makes iPhone that changes according to the market.
