![snappa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-sites-to-get-free-images-05.JPG)

Snappa is one of my favorite sites for free images because it's easy to navigate, has a wide selection of photos and graphics, and doesn't require attribution or watermarks.

The site has an extensive library of free stock photos, vectors, mockups, and templates categorized by industry (e.g., technology), scene (e.g., cityscapes), and more.

You can also choose whether you want to display ads on your site. If you want to keep them off completely, there is an option that allows users who visit your site to download high-resolution copies at no cost (as long as they attribute credit).

And that's it! I hope these sites help you find the perfect image for your project.
