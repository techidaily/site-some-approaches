_Successfully reduces 49,000 manual hours annually when combined with RPA_

[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), an intelligent automation company, announced that ITOCHU Corporation (Headquarters: Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan), one of Japan’s largest trading companies, has integrated ABBYY's intelligent document processing (IDP) platform with its digital transformation (DX) platform.

As part of ITOCHU Corporation's company-wide DX initiatives, it introduced IDP with robot process automation (RPA) to improve the efficiency of paper-based order transactions.

ABBYY IDP solutions have a high reading accuracy and can handle everything from simple fixed forms to complex atypical forms. By combining IDP with RPA, we have succeeded in reducing the overall work time by 49,000 hours per year. The fact that ABBYY supports not only the cloud but also on-premises makes it easy to operate from security a viewpoint, and it was a decisive factor in our selection. As a result of the improved productivity in order-placing and trade-related operations, we plan to scale ABBYY in many areas, such as improving productivity in financial statement analysis and other departments.   
  
We are working to improve the efficiency of operations through a DX platform using RPA for common operations. However, there were many transactions in paper forms and cases where it was difficult to utilize RPA. Therefore, we decided to incorporate IDP for digitalization. After evaluating various IDP solutions, we selected ABBYY because it is highly customizable and suitable for business transformation. In the future, we plan to utilize it to promote DX across group companies.

I am very pleased that ABBYY's technology is contributing to ITOCHU's digital transformation conversion. Continuing our momentum with ITOCHU Corporation, we look forward to supporting not only the trading company industry where many paper business issues remain, but also companies in the finance and logistics industries. Our goal is to continuously innovate our products with capabilities that promote business automation and efficiency for our many customers in Japan and make a significant contribution to productivity and business expansion.
