## The Complete Guide to Decluttered Image Designs on Canva

Canva is a free online platform where you can easily create beautiful designs. Millions of people worldwide use it for multiple purposes, such as making announcements, invitations, business cards, etc.

The background remover tool is one of the most helpful features of Canva, especially for those who want to create professional-looking designs without hiring a designer.

However, if you need to learn how to use the tool and remove an image's Background in Canva, we're here to help you figure this out through our comprehensive step-by-step guide.

## How To Use Canva To Remove Image's Background

Canva is beloved by bloggers and small businesses for its simple, intuitive design interface and range of features, including its background-removing capability that can help to create a Pinterest graphic or blog post with a clean and professional look.

Here's a quick step-by-step guide on how to use Canva to remove the background from an image on PC or mobile:

### On PC

To remove the image's background in Canva using your PC, follow the steps below:

Step1

* Launch a browser on your computer.
* Head to the [Canva website](https://www.canva.com/website-builder/templates/).
* Create a new account or sign in to your existing one.

Step2 Click **"Create a Design"** and select **"Edit Photo."** Click the **"Use in a Design"** option from the top right corner of the pop-up screen.

Step3 Now, you will be directed to a new tab. Select your image and click the **"Edit Image"** option from the top ribbon.

Step4 From the left side menu, click **"Background Remover."** Wait for the background to be processed and click **"Erase."** You can also use the cursor brush to remove the sides manually.

Once the background is disappeared, click **"Apply"** to save your changes.

### On Mobile

The following steps will help you remove the image's background in Canva using its mobile app. The steps for iOS and Android systems are similar, and here we use an Android telephone as an example:

Step1 Install Canva from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canva-design-photo-video/id897446215) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canva.editor&hl=en&gl=US) in first step. Launch the app and tap the purple "Plus" icon at the bottom-right of the screen.

![remove an image background in canva on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/remove-an-image-background-in-canva-on-mobile.png)

Step2 Go to the **"More Ways To Create"** section and tap the **"See All"** option. Select your image and tap **"Create"** at the top right corner of the screen.

Step3 Next, tap the **"Effects"** option from the menu below and select **"BG Remover."** Wait for the tool to process your image and remove the background.

**Note:** The **"Background Remover"** is available only in the premium version, letting you remove BG from up to 500 images daily.

## Facilitate Functions Of Removing Image's Background More Accurately

Follwing the above guidance, you can remove the image's background with Canva with ease. However, there are two must-see functions in Canva which facilitate the accuracy of background removal.

Canva's Erase and Restore function makes it easy to remove image backgrounds. [With **Erase**](#%5FTo%5Ferase%5Fan), you can select and erase specific elements from an image. [With **Restore**](#%5FTo%5Fundo%5Fan), you can undo any accidental erasures. Here's a quick overview of how to use these two functions:

![erase and restore options in canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/erase-and-restore-options-in-canva.png)

### To erase an element from an image

Step1 Select the **Erase** brush from the left panel under the **Background Remover** option

Step2 Adjust the size of the **erase tool** to fit the element you want to remove.

Step3 Select the **element** you want to remove.

### To undo an erase

Step1 Select the **Restore** brush from the left panel under the **Background Remover** option

Step2 Click on the **area** you want to restore.

**Note:** These tools are only available in the Canva web and desktop version.
