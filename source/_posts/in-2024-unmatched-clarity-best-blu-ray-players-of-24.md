You might be in search of Blu-Ray Players that is why you are directed to this page. Don’t worry; here you will get complete details about important considerations related to selection of a new Blu-Ray player as well as price based common differences. The article below will also introduce top 10 blu-ray players with 3 different categories of price. This content can help you to make better decision about buying a new Blu-Ray player for your streaming and playback needs; you will also be able to find best features in a budget friendly device.

## Important Factors to Consider about Blu-Ray Players

**1\. Performance based upon Usability and Quality:**

As users these days are considering Blu-Ray players one important part of their home theatre so their usability and quality becomes essential aspect. During our evaluation process, we focused upon interactive support offered by player interface, loading speeds and user friendly settings. It is advised to buy a Blu-Ray player with adjustable settings for subtitles, audio sources, sub-menu supports etc. Further, boot time of every player was evaluated as it helps to know about how easily users can reach to quick start settings. Also, the build quality of player along with its design was observed and specifications were compared for all top models.

**2\. Connectivity with External world:**

Most of the home theatre systems appear mess of cables but if you work on Blu-Ray players then everything can be managed with ease. Before you make a new investment, make analysis over what kind of cables and connections are suitable for your need. Do you need HDMI connectivity? What kind of audio standards are workable at your home theatre platform? And in case if you wish to install a dedicated multimedia hub then do you need a USB port with your player? All these connectivity related issues must be answered before making investment on a new product. Never forget to check for streaming app functions and its requirement for Wi-Fi connections. Note that most of the budget friendly players are designed with Ethernet Jack whereas high end models may have Wi-Fi facilities.

**3\. Advanced Features:**

When we talk about advanced features then first thing that comes into our mind is 4K and 3D support. Your Blu-Ray player must be capable enough to handle high definition playbacks. However, most of the high end models and mid range products offer good playback options. 4K resolution refers to 3840x2160 pixels on frame with crystal clear image quality. There are two possibilities for 4K content on Blu-Ray Players: either you can buy one with native 4K support or prefer to go for a player that has ability to upscale simulation of 4K image. 3D support is also equally important for your home theatre but in order to get best results with 4K and 3D abilities it is important to stream over HDTV.

**4\. App Support for Streaming:**

Most of the Blu-Ray users demand easy to use application support for their streaming needs that is why manufacturers these days are focusing upon this ability. Most of the blu-ray players follow streaming applications like Hulu and Netflix. You can easily find these application either on app stores or in player menu and they offer easy controls over streaming activities. However, these applications are designed with variable layout and menu options by all every manufacturer.

## More Tips

1\. Can I stream or it demands Disc?

There is no doubt to say that these media players are designed to handle content from discs but it clearly doesn’t mean that they cannot stream. You can easily find so many devices that offer impressive streaming services along with built in Wi-Fi connectivity. Although, you can observe little clunky interfaces on most of players or in few cases HBO may be missing but if you are tight on budget then they are far better solutions. It can easily serve your basic needs.

2\. How much Budget I need to Prepare?

You can have flexibility as per your budget range because a player can cost as high as about $3000 or even more and as low as up to $200\. But one must know that features are varying with price range and quality is also variable. High end players can handle data translations from Blu-Ray with much impressive results whereas with low priced products you may have to make few compromises. If you spend more than you can expect services for 3D compatibility, intuitive user interface, satisfactory audio-video quality and many more. However, there is no hard and fast rule about which feature will vary with price. Users can decide their budget first and then check detailed reviews of all products to make valuable comparison.
