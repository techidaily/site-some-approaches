Since qualified people who can deal with online security threats are limited, security teams have had to reevaluate their strategies on a regular basis. In addition to that, security products are simply being outshined by the increasing challenges of protecting active, computer-generated, and shared environments.

According to [statistics on internet usage](https://www.dailywireless.org/internet/usage-statistics/), the size of the global public cloud computing service market is estimated to have reached over 182 billion U.S. dollars. For that reason, organizations, whether big or small, are aware that transitioning to cloud services is very important to advancement and innovation. They are aware that they cannot afford to slow down the development of their digital revolution. In addition to that, they are deeply mindful that the public cloud is turning out to be a target of choice for cyber-attacks. The possibility of leveraging the power of data to drive [digital transformation](https://abbyy.cloud/) also seem to encourage wayward people to take advantage of susceptibilities and exposures in cloud computing..

To steer clear of security incidents that may put your online security at risk, here are a few [cloud security best practices](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/03/08/the-top-five-cybersecurity-strategies-for-cloud/#13057a6f54b1) to help you make the most of the cloud.

**Adopt a unified approach to cloud security**

The bigger the number of businesses moving to the cloud, the bigger the attack surface that could attract more threats. For effective threat protection in the era of the cloud, businesses need to build a consolidated, simplified, and strong cloud security with real-time threat detection, centralized visibility, and adaptive enforcement. One way of achieving this is by partnering with cloud security solution vendors that have both experience and expertise to provide consolidated cloud security.

**Promote a shared responsibility for cloud security among employees**

In order for your cloud transformation to be effective, you have to promote a shared responsibility of cloud security by connecting the concept of business growth to security. Keep in mind that no organization or individual working alone can put an end to cybercrime. Individuals at every level within the organization - from staff members to board members - is required to have cloud security knowledge. For instance, bosses can lead by example by way of requiring and enforcing training on device-to-cloud security and by encouraging each and every employee to undergo training in cybersecurity.

**Get better perceptibility to cloud services**

Organizations equipped with security tools and technologies to provide complete visibility into their cloud environment are more advantageous. This is because they can effortlessly implement cloud security policies and can reap the benefits of cost savings related to the cloud faster. On the other hand, poor perceptibility can cause insecurity and can possibly impede cloud adoption. That is why it is important to use devices that monitor and give you feedback on which cloud services are being used. This will also allow you to see where your information is going as well as what kind of information is being shared at any particular time.

**Invest more in cloud security**

While using cloud services help to drastically reduce your capex costs, investing more in cloud security gives you peace of mind to focus more on improving customer experience. Of course, you are still the one responsible for keeping and guarding your information in the cloud, but keep in mind that you do not have to do it by yourself.

**Keep Your Staff Informed on Cloud Security**

Today, most businesses struggle to manage security for the cloud services they get. By 2021, as many as 3.5 million cybersecurity positions will be vacant, according to [Cybersecurity Ventures](https://cybersecurityventures.com/jobs/). To lessen the effect of the cybersecurity skills scarcity, adopt a platform approach to cut the number of custom-built security technologies your business need to operate. Another approach to lessen the effect of the cybersecurity skills unavailability is to control best practices as well as models. In addition to that, there are a number of innovative strategies to maintain rapid growth as well as keep the best people in your business. These strategies have to do with gamification methods, real-world permeation analysis for cloud susceptibilities, and opportunities subsidized by other establishments to take part in realistic cyber-attack mockups, which are exclusive to the cloud.
