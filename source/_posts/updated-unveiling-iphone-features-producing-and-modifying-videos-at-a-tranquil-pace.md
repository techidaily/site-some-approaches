Recording videos with iPhone is always great and fun. The iPhone has a fantastic camera with extraordinary features. Apart from the normal recording mode, you can also record videos with iPhone 5s and later iPhones in two other modes: slow-motion and time-lapse mode.

The iPhone slo-mo video capturing mode can take most attractive videos, especially for action shots like explosions and flowing water. Let’s explore the slow-motion video iPhone feature and learn how to record and make slow-motion videos with iPhone. In this article, I'll share:

### Some Important Facts to Know about Shooting Slow Motion Video in iPhone

**Capture Screenshot** \- You can capture stills while shooting iPhone slow motion videos. Tap on the white button at the left bottom corner of the screen and a high resolution snapshot is automatically saved in the Camera Roll folder beside the recorded video.

![capture still image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/still-camera.JPG)

**Supported Slow** \- Mo Shooting Modes- Do you know the slow motion recording modes supported by iPhone?

iPhone 5s only can capture 720p at 120 FPS. iPhone 6/6 Plus/6s/6s Plus, iPhone 7/7 Plus can capture 720p at 240 FPS. iPhone 8/8 Plus and iPhone X can even capture 1080p HD at 240 FPS.

**Space used by slo-mo video** \- It is vital to know that the iPhone 5s onwards iOS devices record slow motion video at 120 frames per second (fps). If you record slow motion video at higher frame rates, it takes lesser space than 120fps video.

The slo-mo video recorded at 1080p resolution at 120 fps uses approximately 375 MB per minute storage space and slow motion video iPhone resolution of 720p at 240 fps uses approximately 300 MB per minute.

**Is slow motion video from normal video possible** \- A higher frame rate than normal is required to record a slow motion video., Playing a slow motion video to normal is possible but the reverse is impossible. You get a jerky video with frames jumping here and there when you try to watch a slow motion video from normal. It appears as a series of still snapshots rather than a constant video.

## Part 2: How to Change Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion

If you’ve recorded a video on iPhone in normal speed and want to turn it into a slow-motion video, or if you can’t record a slow-motion video with your iPhone, you can use some third-party apps to convert them to slow motion videos. Here, we can recommend some [video speed changing apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for turning normal speed video into slow-motion videos.

#### 1. [SLOPRO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slopro/id507232505?mt=8)

SloPro is a free tool for creating iPhone slow motion videos. Start recording instantly post launching SLOPRO. Once you are done, select the video from the library and tap the red colored edit button at the top right corner. Next, highlight the part of the video you wish to slow down using the clip out and clip in button. Now, to set the slow motion options, it is recommended to select between 500fps and 1000fps. You can slow the video by 25%, 40%, or 50%.

Once all set, tap Render and select the Optical Flow to get the best parameters. Finally, save So if you liked SloPro, get the full version within the app.the video and share it with your friends on Facebook and YouTube.

The free version of the SLOPRO carries watermark which is indeed a drawback. Get the full version of the app to avoid such issues.

#### 2. [Slow Motion Video Camera Extreme](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slow-motion-camera-extreme/id816154538?mt=8)

Although there are not much editing options available, you can select a video from Camera Roll or record a high quality video, slow the speed of the video by 25%, 50% or 75% by clicking on the 50% sign. To add a song to your iPhone slow motion video movie, click on the Music sign.

#### Conclusion
