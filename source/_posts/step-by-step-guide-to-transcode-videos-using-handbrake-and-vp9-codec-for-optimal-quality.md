VP9 now occupies very great proportion of YouTube videos. Plus, Chrome, Firefox and even Microsoft Edge implements WebM VP9 codec as well, owning to the high efficient video compression ratio. Like many other tools VLC 2.1.2, [FFmpeg](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), SUPER, MPlayer, Libav, DirectShow Filters supporting VP9 encoding, Handbrake 1.0.0 finally infuses new MKV presets for VP9 video encoding and Opus audio encoding with libvpx.

Handbrake VP9 Encoder

**Step 1:** Launch Handbrake. Different from the previous edition, you can directly add a single file or a whole video folder at the left side and then wait for Handbrake scanning. Or just click the Source button to do so as before. 

**Step 2:** Click Browse button to choose the destination where you want to save the file. 

**Step 3:** Go to Presets - Matroska - VP9 MKV. Handbrake offers 4 presets for VP9 MKV at resolutions of 1080p, 720p, 576p and 480p. It's at your disposal to choose to fit for your specific needs with balanced speed and file size, without needing to tweak the bit rate, resolution, codec, frame rate, etc. But you shall note that there is MKV VP9 encoding available.   
**Note:** If you use [Handbrake Mac version](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), please go to the Video Encoder to choose VP9 manually as there isn't MKV VP9 preset in Handbrake Mac version. 

**Step 4:** Tap the Start Encode button to begin VP9 encoding with Handbrake.

**Framerate (FPS)**: Choose Same as source and check Variable Framerate as it uses available space more efficiently than CBR and outputs less artifacts in the video.  
**Quality**: If you want to encode VP9 with smaller size, just lower the constant quality at below 22 as it will result in smaller size with acceptable quality. Or else, you can tweak the constant quality at 23 for balancing the quality and file size.   
**Optimise Video**: Set the Encoder Preset in the middle of the bar. Typically, if you higher the setting, it will output higher quality but leads to longer encoding time.
