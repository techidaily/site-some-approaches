## Part 2\. How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?

The best way to present any news related to any sports event is to create a short video containing all the highlights of the event. For example, you can create a video combining all the highlights of short track speed skating 2022 that we have presented in the previous section. You can also collect short clips of the event from social media platforms that have been captured by audiences.

To create such a highlight video on any sports event, there are certain videos effects commonly used that you should know about.

**Transitions** – Since you are going to use a lot of still photos, the transition from one photo to another should be smooth. This is where transition effects come into the play so that the viewer does not feel any jarring effect and sudden changes as they move from one slide in your video to another.

**Slow Motion** – If you have collected from short clips of the event, you can use slow motion effect to prolong the clip and give enough time for your viewer to watch it. Slow motion effect is quite captivating and intriguing in today’s videography world.

**Motion Tracking** – Using motion tracking, you can track the movement of a particular object or athlete in a video. This helps to attach certain elements such as clipart, text, icon to that particular athlete throughout the video for easy identification by the viewers.

**Pan and Zoom** – Pan and Zoom is the most commonly used video effect that is applied to still footage. While the footage zooms out, texts and titles are shown or a voiceover is played so that the graphic on the screen does not stay static.
