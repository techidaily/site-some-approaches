If your iPhone is not playing podcasts, there's usually a problem with downloading or syncing the podcast with other devices.

There are several reasons why this process can be interrupted or unavailable. For example, an unstable Internet connection or any issue with the podcast servers. Another reason for the podcast not playing could be a bug or a misconfiguration of the podcast app. The Apple Podcasts app doesn't provide many error warnings.

3. Ensure the appropriate audio output is chosen.
4. Redownload the podcast after erasing it from your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. When downloaded, files can sometimes become corrupt.
