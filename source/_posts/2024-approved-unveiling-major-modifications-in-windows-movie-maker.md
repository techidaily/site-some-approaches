## 1\. First Release

### **Download Link:** [**Windows Movie Maker**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-za/download/details.aspx?id=18242)

The initial version was included with Windows Me in 2000, but Windows 2000, which came out months before, did not have it, which is why it was missing from the latter. Industry players didn't really pay much attention to WMM since it didn't provide enough features to compete with its rivals. Microsoft chose to produce version 1.1 after realizing WMM's drawbacks. That version was made available at the same time as the Windows XP OS from Microsoft.

![windows movie maker 2000](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/windows-movie-maker-2000.jpg)

For this, Windows Movie Maker's first port was created. On the right side, a video preview is shown. There is room to add images, music, and other media on the left. The plot may be found at the very bottom. Even with capabilities like file input, live video recording, clip segmentation, clip organization, post-production editing, Windows Media file export functionality, and email sharing ability, the WMM version was still subpar.

## 2\. Windows Vista

### **Download Link:** [**Windows Movie Maker**](https://windows-movie-maker-for-vista.soft32.com/)

A capture wizard included with WMM6 produces DVR-MS-style files from HDV tapes but is unable to record video. Vista is needed for installation.

## 3\. Windows Live

### **Download Link:** [**Windows Movie Maker**](https://windows-live-movie-maker.en.download.it/)

Microsoft chose to offer a new version of Windows Movie Maker after recognizing that it would not be compatible with other operating systems when it was developed for Vista. As a stand-alone utility, Microsoft releases this product on the market. On August 19, 2009, Microsoft officially made it available as a standalone product. To create animated films, you may effortlessly import, edit, and save audio, picture, and video data using Live Movie Maker's user-friendly interface.
