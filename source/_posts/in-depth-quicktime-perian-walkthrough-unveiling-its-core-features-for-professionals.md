Perian, the swiss-army knife of QuickTime components, is designed to expand the file formats and subtitles supported by QuickTime Player. With the components installed on macOS, QuickTime is able to handle a motley collection of formats, from the commonly used MKV, FLV, MPEG-4, H.264, H.263, WebM, VP8, SRT/SSA subtitles to the less known formats HuffYUV, and more. If you are still using this component for QuickTime 7.6.6 or older, get started with QuickTime Perian tutorial and learn how to download, install and use it for Mac. Note that if you are using QuickTime 10 or above, the most efficient way to play videos on QuickTime without unsupported video container/codec format issues is to use a video converter for Mac.

## FAQ: QuickTime Not Working with Perian

On you Mac, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Allow apps downloaded from… and set your preference, try to open Perian again to see if it works. For any users who can't open Perian for QuickTime, we suggest checking if the components are compatible with the version of QuickTime and macOS.

**2\. QuickTime with Perian won't open AVI files**

_Q: QuickTime refuses to play AVI files in QuickTime 7\. Any straightforward solution for this problem?_   
It's common that [QuickTime won't play AVI](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) files even you have Perian installed on your computer. AVI is a container format introduced by Microsoft, which can contain different types of video and audio codecs unsupported by Perian.

* Try other QuickTime Player alternative, for instance, VLC Media Player, 5KPlayer, MPlayerX etc.
