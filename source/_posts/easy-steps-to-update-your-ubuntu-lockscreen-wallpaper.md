##  How to Change the Ubuntu Lock Screen Background

 Changing Ubuntu's lock screen background is done the same way as on [any other operating system, like Windows](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/auroras-influence-on-modern-image-processing-techniques-for-2024/). Simply right-click on your desktop and click the "Change Background" option.

 After setting the new lock screen image, you will notice that the lock screen image has a default blur effect. We'll show you how to remove this blur later in this tutorial.

##  How to Remove the Lock Screen Blur Effect on Ubuntu

 To remove the blur effect from the lock screen background image, first, you need to install GNOME Extension Manager. After that, add a lock screen blur control extension to your system.

 Ubuntu usually adds a blur effect to the lock screen background. This makes it look more aesthetic and hides the details of the image. But if you want, you can remove this blur effect and choose a clear and sharp image for your lock screen.

 Simply, open the terminal and run:

sudo apt install gnome-shell-extensions gnome-shell-extension-manager

![Terminal with installation command of GNOME extension manager](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8.png) 

 After installing GNOME Extension Manager, open it and search for the "Lock Screen Background" extension. Then, click on the "Install" button to add a lock screen blur control extension.

 Once the extension is installed, navigate to the "Installed" tab. Find and enable the "Control Blur Effect on Lock Screen" extension. Then, click on the gear icon to customize this extension.
