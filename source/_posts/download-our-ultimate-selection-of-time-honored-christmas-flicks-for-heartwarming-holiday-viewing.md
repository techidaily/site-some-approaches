## 1\. Last Christmas (2019)

This is a romantic comedy film released on Nov 8, 2019\. Praised for teh performance and chemistry of Clarke and Golding, it is still a good movie to watch on Christmas Day.

## 2\. Office Christmas Party (2016)

 Its cast of gifted comics is good for a handful of laughs, but Office Christmas Party's overstuffed plot ultimately proves roughly as disappointing as its clichéd gags and forced sentimentality. In OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY, when the CEO tries to close her hard-partying brother's branch, he and his Chief Technical Officer must rally their co-workers and host an epic office Christmas party in an effort to impress a potential client and close a sale that will save their jobs. It could be the funniest Christmas movies this holiday. 

## 3\. Almost Christmas (2016)

Almost Christmas tells a story of a dysfunctional family gathers together for their first Christmas since their mom died. It's enjoyable, light hearted, entertaining and better than expected. Not quite worth the big screen ticket but great for an easy-going comedy. 

## 4\. Arthur Christmas (2011)

Relatively, as a [classic Christmas movie](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), Arthur Christmas reveals the incredible, never-before seen answer to every child's question: 'So how does Santa deliver all those presents in one night?' The answer: Santa's exhilarating, ultra-high-tech operation hidden beneath the North Pole. But at the center of the film is a story about a family in a state of comic dysfunction and an unlikely hero, Arthur, with an urgent mission that must be completed before Christmas morning dawns.

Xmas movies Frozen II

## 5\. Miracle on 34th Street (1947) 

The story takes place between Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day in New York City. A mother named Doris is very busy so that she doesn't have time to be with her little daughter Susan. A man called Kris finds the person assigned to play Santa in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is drunk. Without other better solutions, Doris persuades Kris to take his place. He does such a fine job on 34th Street. 

What makes her amazed is that after the end of the parade, Kris still claims himself as real Santa. At first, Doris and Susan regard Kris as insane. Gradually, Susan finds indeed he is very special. Rated in 7.9 out of 10 on IMDb, Miracle on 34th Street has always been regarded as one of the classic Christmas movies of all time.

## 6\. A Christmas Story (1983) 

This plot-rich movie talks about a 9 years old boy known as Ralpie who deems the perfect Christmas gift is a Red Ryder BB gun, which is considered as a very dangerous gift in the 1940s.

The most interesting part of this lies in the kid's rich world, which lets you think of your childhood. Besides, Ralphie's monologue is the voice from a mature man so as to infuse much more humorous elements to it. It definitely tops the list of the [kids-friendly Christmas movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) among the classics. 

## 7\. Christmas Vacation (1989)

The hero Clark intends to plan an extended family Christmas, while things go athwart that Clark's parents and parents-in-law turn it to be a big disaster. They chatter without a stop, blame one another and quarrel continuously as if the World War once again breaks out. The situation is totally in a mess. Perhaps one of the most suitable Christmas classic movies to watch on vacation.

## 8\. Home Alone (1990)

This film represents an eight-year-old boy, Kevin who is inadvertently left alone at home, bravely defeats two thieves with his self-made funny traps. If you want to watch a classic Christmas comedy movie that makes you explode roars of laughter from the very beginning to the end, it's just the one.

Xmas movies Frozen II

## 9\. Bad Santa (2003)

As a must-see classic Christmas movie, this film is also a comedy that a miserable deceiver and his partner pose as Santa and his little helper to rob department stores on Christmas Eve. But they sink into problems when the security staff suspects them and the department manager discovers the plot. And what drives up to the wall is that a troubled kid also puts an eye on them.

Supposing you are curious about whether they can succeed in robbing stores, you definitely can't miss it. BTW, the Bad Santa 2 has been released in Nov 23, 2016\. Thus you can not only enjoy the classic but also the [new release Christmas movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) at a stroke in this December. 

## 10\. Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1994)

This Christmas animation short classic mainly narrates a red-nosed reindeer Rudolph who is ousted by its ethnic group looks for a shelter in a small island with its friends. Later, it wants to salvage the bullied toys so that it turns to Father Christmas for help. To its surprise, the Santa's sleigh can't function in the strong smog.

## 11\. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)

Here comes another classic Christmas animation movie adorned with songs and dance, full of fantasy and a little bit panic.
