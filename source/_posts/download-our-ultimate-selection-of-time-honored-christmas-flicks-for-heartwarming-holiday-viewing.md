## 1\. Last Christmas (2019)

This is a romantic comedy film released on Nov 8, 2019\. Praised for teh performance and chemistry of Clarke and Golding, it is still a good movie to watch on Christmas Day.

## 2\. Office Christmas Party (2016)

 Its cast of gifted comics is good for a handful of laughs, but Office Christmas Party's overstuffed plot ultimately proves roughly as disappointing as its clichéd gags and forced sentimentality. In OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY, when the CEO tries to close her hard-partying brother's branch, he and his Chief Technical Officer must rally their co-workers and host an epic office Christmas party in an effort to impress a potential client and close a sale that will save their jobs. It could be the funniest Christmas movies this holiday.

## 3\. Almost Christmas (2016)

Almost Christmas tells a story of a dysfunctional family gathers together for their first Christmas since their mom died. It's enjoyable, light hearted, entertaining and better than expected. Not quite worth the big screen ticket but great for an easy-going comedy. 

## 4\. Arthur Christmas (2011)

Relatively, as a [classic Christmas movie](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), Arthur Christmas reveals the incredible, never-before seen answer to every child's question: 'So how does Santa deliver all those presents in one night?' The answer: Santa's exhilarating, ultra-high-tech operation hidden beneath the North Pole. But at the center of the film is a story about a family in a state of comic dysfunction and an unlikely hero, Arthur, with an urgent mission that must be completed before Christmas morning dawns.

## 5\. Miracle on 34th Street (1947) 

The story takes place between Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day in New York City. A mother named Doris is very busy so that she doesn't have time to be with her little daughter Susan. A man called Kris finds the person assigned to play Santa in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is drunk. Without other better solutions, Doris persuades Kris to take his place. He does such a fine job on 34th Street. 

What makes her amazed is that after the end of the parade, Kris still claims himself as real Santa. At first, Doris and Susan regard Kris as insane. Gradually, Susan finds indeed he is very special. Rated in 7.9 out of 10 on IMDb, Miracle on 34th Street has always been regarded as one of the classic Christmas movies of all time.

## 6\. A Christmas Story (1983) 

This plot-rich movie talks about a 9 years old boy known as Ralpie who deems the perfect Christmas gift is a Red Ryder BB gun, which is considered as a very dangerous gift in the 1940s.

The most interesting part of this lies in the kid's rich world, which lets you think of your childhood. Besides, Ralphie's monologue is the voice from a mature man so as to infuse much more humorous elements to it. It definitely tops the list of the [kids-friendly Christmas movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) among the classics.
