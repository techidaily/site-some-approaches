Nowadays streaming movies and TV series over Netflix or Hulu greatly replaces the physical DVD entertainment. So the way of shifting from the physical format to digital standard is in vogue, which, on the one hand, it keeps the hundreds of DVD discs from scratch or damage, thus avoiding loss of important data, while it, on the other hand, saves your mountains of DVD discs onto your computer hard drive, NAS or cloud storage in a very smaller size, specially when you choose to rip and convert DVD discs to HEVC, the video compression standard designed to substantially improve coding efficiency. And this is the guide where it comes in. Before doing the DVD to HEVC ripping with a HEVC converter, there are something you need to bear in mind:

**1\. Removing DVD copy protection is important.**  
A great many of users blame some free DVD ripper software for the failure to rip DVDs. Tech geeks may understand ripping movies on DVDs to H.265/HEVC or other some formats fall flat out of sheer copy protection systems encoded on these commercial DVDs, intended to stop DVD ripping software from copying the movies and TV series out of the physical format. These systems include CSS, Region Code, RCE, UOP, Sony ARccOS, Disney X-project DRM and more. So if a DVD ripper cannot [remove copy protection from DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), the DVD to HEVC conversion will led nowhere.

DVD to H265

**2\. Hardware acceleration is a trump card.**  
Converting a full-length DVD movie used to take as long as 30-60 minutes, this is time-wasting, especially when you have hundreds of DVD discs. Consequently, a fast DVD ripper is much sought after. The good news is that a few of these programs manage to support the hardware acceleration tech like Intel QSV and NVIDIA NVENC to speed up the process. This makes a full DVD rip as short as 10 minutes, such as MacX DVD Ripper Pro and Handbrake. 

**3\. Why Digitize DVD to HEVC/H.265 not H.264**   
First of all, HEVC/H.265 doubles the data compression ratio at the same level of video quality compared with H.264\. This means it offers better image quality in the same size or reduces video file size by half at the same level of video quality. Generally, a full-length DVD movie comes in 4.7 GB single and 9.4 GB double-sided sizes, while by ripping DVD movies to HEVC/H.265, it greatly saves your hard drive space at a size of around 150MB.
