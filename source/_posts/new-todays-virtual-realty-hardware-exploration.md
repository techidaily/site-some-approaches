 The promises made by Virtual Reality Hardware have always been massive and quite thrilling to some extent. According to the concept, put on those bulky goggles and transport yourself to a brand new world without going anywhere. People often compare this with the escapism achieved through drugs, alcohol and sex. But that is altogether a different context and let’s not get into that.

## The Virtual Reality Hardware Market Analysis

 Right in this moment, there are basically three major players in the market. HTC Vive and Oculus Rift are considered as the best compared to Samsung. Samsung Gear VR is regarded for the middle class since it hasn’t yet been able to show the result that is expected.

 On the other hand, the sales figure of HTC Vive is creating new highs with time. They have recently announced that their sales figure will soon reach the 100,000 mark. If we consider the market since its appearance, this is too young now and the sales figure of HTC is pretty impressive no doubt.

 However, a recent rumor has ignited the sale of Oculus Rift. The buzz is that Facebook is backing this VR giant. Though, no confirmation has been made from both the sides. But users are not bothered about the confirmation.

 If we look at the reasons behind the HTC’s grand success in the VR Gear world, it is the superior technology. HTC is more into offering a unique experience to the users with their 15’X15’ room scale experience.

 The Oculus rift is expected to come up with some new features in the second half of 2016 with room scaling and gesture controller. This will help to sense the gestures through infrared dots. This technology can really take the VR Gear experience to a different level.

 Apart from these brands, two other popular technology giants Microsoft and Sony is also coming up with technology that supports VR gaming. Recently Microsoft has unveiled their new iteration of Xbox One that is Xbox One S. It has upgraded platforms which are believed to support VR gaming. Sony has also made an announcement of a new iteration of PS4 which will support VR gaming and it will be released on 13th October this year.

 The market experts believe that the participation of these technology giants in the VR gaming industry will increase the sales and take the market towards maturity.

## What the VR hardware market will be in future

 The prospect of the VR gaming market in the three years is expected to boom literally. More people will get to know about the technology and words of mouth and more promotion will bring in more enthusiasts. The number will hit the million marks as expected.

 This is too early for a technological revolution to take place and there is nothing to be so frustrated at this early age. It needs time and with the increasing awareness the sales will boom. All the companies need to focus at the promotion of this new technology now. They should let the users know how their gaming experience is about to change. In the near future VR Gear is going to be the next big thing in technology.

## Brief overview of VR hardware

 If the opinions of the experts are to be believed, we are still quite far from the mature virtual reality market. But there is no denying the fact that this early stage of technological revolution has created quite a buzz among the technology lovers. Statistics are showing that the VR start ups have garnered $2 billion VC funding so far.

 OK, so within this early stage, we have already a few names that are controlling the VR hardware market. Here is three of the best VR hardware presently available in the market. Let’s have a look at their details.

#### [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/  )

 This is so far the most popular VR hardware in the present time. According to the records, they will soon achieve the 100, 000 marks. It has 2160X1200 pixel OLED display. The refresh rate is 90 Hz. It requires either NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or Radeon R9 280 hardware. And as for the processor, it is suitable with Intel Core i5-4590 processor or greater version.
