_I'm using the latest version of Handbrake on the Mac. When I rip a DVD, handbrake shows that it will rip DVD to mp4 format. However, when the rip is complete, the file format is m4v. How can I make sure that the file is ripped to the mp4 format not M4V using Handbrake?_

_Hi everyone, I was curious if there was a possibility to change handbrake's default .m4v container to a regular .mp4 container? Because some .m4v files don't like to work on some of my consoles._

![Handbrake M4V to MP4](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake-logo.png) 

At some point Handbrake DVD decoder users found there were constant DVD video playback issues as Handbrake rips [new DVD movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to M4V format, not MP4\. A typical problem is that QuickTime as well as some other consoles like Android reports an error when playing the encoded file. To address this problem, we've listed the difference and solutions about M4V vs MP4 for saving ripped DVD to MP4 instead of M4V in Handbrake.

## What's M4V and How It Differs from MP4 Format

**M4V** is a container format developed by Apple and is very similar to the MP4 format. Files saved in .m4v are open in iTunes by default and come with DRM copyright protection to prohibit the access (especially from competitors like Android) for commercial use. So you have to remove iTunes DRM from M4V video for easy playback on Android based devices. Compared with M4V, MP4 has no copy protection restriction and is compatible with almost all media players. That's why people prefer MP4 to M4V when Handbrake Mac rips DVD. 

## Reasons Why Handbrake Saves DVD as M4V Not MP4 

Like the cases above, Handbrake (Since version 0.9.5) saves DVD and video as M4V rather than familiar MP4\. Why? Generally, Handbrake stores audio in the AAC format, which possibly passes through AC3 audio from a DVD in an MP4 file. For MP4 files, Handbrake will automatically use the M4V extension if your output contains AC3 audio, SRT subtitles or chapter markers. The reason for this is that QuickTime or any QT based apps will refuse to play a MP4 file with these features enabled, unless the extension is .m4v. 

Despite Handbrake mentions that there are no differences between MP4 and M4V and there is an option in HandBrakes preferences to select the extension, it's recommended not to change M4V to MP4 in Handbrake if containing AC3 audio as it therefore won't be played on QuickTime. For users who plan to use Handbrake to rip DVD to MP4, they might feel quite unpleasant.

## How to Open and Play Handbrake M4V Files on Apple Android Devices with No Issues

Since it makes no sense to change the file extension in Handbrake from M4V to MP4 back and forth, you can simply convert M4V to MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, MKV, FLV, etc with the help of a video converter. And [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) proves to be the ultimate Handbrake alternative with stunning M4V to MP4 video converting ability as well as other exciting features, letting you not only convert M4V to MP4, AVI and other formats but also directly transcode M4V to be Android, Microsoft and Google compatible formats with no quality loss.
