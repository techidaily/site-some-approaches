## Part 2\. Key features of PicsArt app

The PicsArt free app has a lot of amazing features for editing photos however, we are going to list the key features of this app that makes it stand out from other photo editing apps.

**Photo and Artwork Remix:** this is one of the features that the photo edit app PicsArt, has that makes it unique and different from other photo editing apps. With this feature, you can be able to remake a picture or artwork that has already been edited by another user.

**Magic Effects:** PicsArt allows you the opportunity to create beautiful artwork out of a photo through its AI-powered filter. The juicy part about this feature is that you can apply these filters to a part of your picture while the other part remains the same. Amazing Right? This is a whole new level from what you see with other photo editor apps with AI-powered filters.

**Drawing Tool:** with over 20 brush types that translate on a 3D plane, PicsArt has given artists the go-ahead to create amazing, beautiful works of art using the app. It photoshop-layers gives you the feeling of drawing on photoshop.

If you also plan on building a career in photo editing and digital arts, this feature will be really helpful. People can see your work and appreciate it by following you. You may also get a job recommendation.
