The DVD decrypting tools are designed to decrypt and remove DVD restrictions, such as Analog Protection System (APS) scrambling, Content Scramble System (CSS) encryption, DVD Disc Corruption (ARccOS, Disney X, etc.), Multiple titles, etc. If you don't know which DVD decypter for Mac is the best or how to decypt a DVD on Mac, just keep reading.

When we selecting the best DVD decrypter software, we've considered the following several factors:

1. Copy protection bypassing ability: A good DVD decryption software should be able to effectively bypass different copy protection methods used on DVDs, such as CSS, region codes, and DRM.
2. Ease of use: The DVD decrypter for Windows 11/10/macOS should have a user-friendly interface and intuitive controls, making it easy for you to decrypt a DVD on PC or Mac.
3. Speed: Consider the ripping speed of the software. Faster DVD decryption and ripping speeds will save you time when converting DVDs to digital formats.
4. Output quality: Ensure that the decrypter maintains the original video and audio quality of the DVD during the decryption and ripping process.

\[**Editor's note:** The MPAA and most media companies do not allow commericial DVD copy. Here we in no way endorse, condone, support or encourage the illegal copying of DVDs and the illegal use of DVD decrypting software. We simply share ways to decrypt protected DVD on Mac for legal personal use only. So check the legality of DVD ripping in your country before you use the Mac DVD decrypters above.\]

## [DVD Decrypter](http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/)

**OS:** Windows 10 and ealier 

DVD Decrypter was a famous tool that people used to decrypt protected DVDs on Windows systems. However, it was discontinued since 2005\. Now you can still download the DVD Decrypter software for Windows from the mirror site or sites like VideoHelp or Softonic. With DVD Decrypter, you can decrypt Bluray, HD-DVD or DVD and remux the content into MKV files. It supports DVDs with region codes, CSS, Macrovision content protection, and UOP.

 As this DVD decryption software hasn't been updated for years, there will be compatibility issues with the latest Windows systems and newer DVD copy protection measures. Some advanced encryptions such as bad sectors, Disney 99 fake titles, and playlist obfuscation are not supported by DVD Decrypter. 

**Pros**

* It's able to free decrypt both DVDs and Blu-ray discs without using extra tools.
* It remuxes the protected DVDs into MKV files with all data and original quality.

**Cons**

* DVD Decrypter is discontinued and not for macOS systems or Windows 11 or later.
* DVD Decrypter can't decrypt DVDs with advanced copy protections.
* DVD Decrypter can only save the decrypted DVD content in an MKV format.

![Free DVD decrypter](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-decrypter-18.jpg)

### How to decrypt a DVD on Windows with DVD Decrypter?

**Step 1\.** Free download DVD Decrypter on your Windows computer and install it. Note that it may not work with that latest Windows 11 systems. For Mac users, try other DVD decryption software on the list. 

**Step 2\.** Launch DVD Decrypter and insert the DVD you want to decrypt into your DVD drive. In DVD Decrypter, go to the "Mode" menu and select "IFO" mode.

**Step 3\.** Click on the "File" menu and choose "Open Disc" to load the DVD. DVD Decrypter will analyze the DVD's contents and display them in the main window. Go to the "Tools" menu and select "Settings" to configure the decryption options. 

**Step 4\.** In the "CSS" tab, make sure the "Remove CSS encryption" option is checked. Click on the "Decrypt" button to start the decryption process. DVD Decrypter will decrypt the DVD and save the decrypted files to your hard drive.

## [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)

**OS:** macOS 10.13 and later, Windows, and Linux 

Handbrake is a free and open-source video transcoder. Out of the box, Handbrake can rip any DVDs without encryptions. But with a free DVD playback library called libdvdcss, Handbrake is able to decrypt copy protected DVDs into MP4, MKV, and WebM formats on Mac, Windows, and Linux. 

 But using Handbrake as a free DVD decrypter for Mac/Windows is not very user-friendly. For example, when you download Handbrake, you need to figure out if your computer is 32- or 64-bit. That's easy. But it becomes harder with the libdvdcss download and installation. To decrypt protected DVDs on Mac and Windows, you need to download Handbrake 32/64 bit (Windows) or download & install libdvdcss with Homebrew (macOS)- adjust the settings - start to rip - and be prepared to fix DVD decrypting errors. 

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free and open-source.
* Handbrake supports GPU acceleration for fast DVD decrypting.
* A wide range of settings to customize the decrypted video.

**Cons**

* Downloading the free DVD decrypter for Handbrake - libdvdcss is a complicated process, especially on Mac.
* libdvdcss is capable to handle CSS scheme, which means the free DVD decrypter for Mac/Windows can't rip DVDs with other protections.

**Step 4.** Click the Browse button to set where you want to save the decrypted DVD movie file. Then click the Start button and now you can decrypt encrypted DVDs with Handbrake on MacBook Air/Pro, Windows PC, etc.

## [MakeMKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

**OS:** Mac OS X 10.7 or later, Windows XP or later, Linux 

MakeMKV is one of the best free DVD decrypters for Mac, Windows, and Linux. It's able to rip both protected or home-made DVDs to MKV videos.

Simply fire up the program, analze the disc, choose which track to rip, set the output directory to save the output MKV files, and hit the MakeMKV button. There is no complex configuration at all. 

You cannot play the MKV file on Apple devices like Apple TV, or iOS devices, or synce to iTunes. But you can use additional software like HandBrake to convert the MKV into Mac/Apple's format. Note that the functions to decrypt Blu-ray discs are not free. 

**Pros**

* It's free, simple, and straightforward to use.
* MakeMKV does not require additional software or codecs to decrypt a DVD.
* The free DVD decrypter can decrypt both encrypted DVD and Blu-ray discs.

* MakeMKV does not provide users the possibility of configuring audio and video parameters.

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/cons-icon.png) **DVD reading errors.** Myriad DVD reading problems come up with protected DVDs. For example, the infamous anydvd file IO3 error, AnyDVD not recognizing region code, getting a read error at 50%, Handbrake can't find the right title, DVD player won't open up the disk, DVD shows as empty, DVD not appearing/not responding... 

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/cons-icon.png) **DVD decrypting hangs/freezes**. Even if the DVD is loaded and recognized successfully, there are still errors. Most commonly, the DVD ripping hangs and freezes in the middle, FPS drop down and DVD ripper quits with an error report popping up, DVD ripping completed with only a few seconds, etc. All those errors are mainly caused by failures to handle encryptions. 

![DVD decrypting errors on Mac](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/decrypt-error.jpg) 

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/cons-icon.png) **Jumpy files/missing frames/artifacts**. The output video files are less than satisfactory.

When a DVD decrypter fails to detect the correct title, a bad/corrupted title will lead to such errors.

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/cons-icon.png) **Incomplete DVD rips**. It seems that your DVD is successfully ripped by the DVD decrypter you used. When you playback the ripped files on desktop, you will find it produces an ISO image of 4MB or only one part of only 6 seconds. 

The troubleshooting of the above [DVD decrypting issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is time-consuming and exhausting. Things don't need to be that complicated if you have a strong DVD decrypting app.

## Part 3\. FAQ about DVD Decryption on Mac and Windows

**1\. Is it legal to decrypt a DVD?**

The legality of ripping protected DVD depends on where you are. In the US, it is illegal to break the encryption or any other type of Digital Rights Management (DRM) on a CD or DVD. You also have a fair use right under copyright law to make a backup copy of a CD or DVD for personal use. Which means you can make a backup copy of a DVD you own for personal use. 

**2\. Does DVD Decrypter work on Mac?**

No. DVD decrypter is a free program on Windows which is able to remove Macrovision content protection, CSS, region codes, and user operation prohibition and create a disk image backup of a DVD. However, it works on Windows only and it was discontinued years ago. 

**3\. Is DVD Decrypter still available?**

DVD Decrypter is no longer available for download from its official website, DVDdecrypter.com. The website was shut down due to legal issues. However, the software may still be hosted on some file-sharing sites. It is important to note that downloading DVD Decrypter from mirroring sites may contain adware and DVD Decrypter no longer supports the latest Windows 11/10 systems. It is recommended to explore alternative solutions for decrypting DVDs.

**4\. Can VLC rip encrypted DVDs?**

VLC is a free and open-source media player which is able to rip DVDs to video files to your hard drive. But you can't use VLC to rip a protected DVD. Instead, you need a dedicated ripper for that. 

**5\. Can I use Mac DVDRipper Pro to rip protected DVDs?**

Whether or not Mac DVDRipper Pro can be used to rip protected DVDs depends on the type of protection used on the DVD. In general, if the DVD has simple CSS encryption, Mac DVDRipper Pro should be able to handle it without major issues. However, if the DVD is protected by more advanced encryption, such as Sony ARccOS, Disney X-Project, or others, Mac DVDRipper Pro would let you down because of its inability to decrypt & rip it without additional software or tools.

## Conclusion

 In conclusion, when it comes to selecting the best DVD decrypter software, there are numerous options available in the market. The top 10 options mentioned in this article, including MacX DVD Ripper Pro, Handbrake, MakeMKV, VLC, etc., offer excellent features and performance. However, the final choice will depend on your specific requirements and preferences.

Factors like copy protection bypassing ability, ease of use, speed, output quality, and support for different disc formats should be considered. It is recommended to read reviews, compare different options, and even try out free trial versions before making a decision.

Overall, MacX DVD Ripper Pro is a good DVD decrypter for Windows 11/10/macOS as it supports decrypting almost all the copy protections on a DVD and converts the decrypted DVD to any video format or device that you may need.
