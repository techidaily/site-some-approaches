Step1 Open your Twitch app and go to any streamer’s channel that is holding a live stream. You can click on the “Rewind the Stream” button given on the bottom right side.

![tap on rewind the stream option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/rewind-twitch-live-stream-7.jpg)
