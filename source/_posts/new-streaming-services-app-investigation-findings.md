## Streaming Services App Investigation Findings

An excellent video editor and movie maker made especially for Android and iOS users. Earning its name in the market due to its friendly interface and highly advanced features, VideoShow is doubtlessly now one of the best mobile phone video editing applications. However, for advanced video editing, you must purchase their premium version.

| **Advantages**                  | **Disadvantages**                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easily understandable interface | It is necessary to share personal data with the application             |
| Advanced editing tools          | Annoying ads in the free version                                        |
| Android and iOS compatibility   | You will frequently push up ads asking you to buy their premium version |
| A free version is available     | Some of its limitations in the free version are very undesired          |

## Part 1\. What is VideoShow Video Editor App?

VideoShow video editor is currently the best option for those who want to edit their videos professionally with much less effort. It has all the updated editing tools which any mobile video editor should have.

**Download:** You can download this application for Android and iOS: [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xvideostudio.videoeditor&hl=en&gl=US) **|** [**iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/videoshow-video-editor-maker/id930380089)

**Price:** Like many other mobile video editing applications, VideoShow video editor also has a premium version which you can purchase. However, you can still use it free using its free version and edit your videos. But it has a few limitations like you have to face annoying ads and bear their watermark on your video. And you cannot access some highly advanced editing tools as well.

### Import

First, click on the video edit button to import your media files to the VideoShow video editor. Then it will take you to a menu where all your mobile's media will appear. You can select the media you want to import and click on the add button. The flaws in its importing are that it cannot separate your media in such a way that your pictures and videos are in different sections. However, thankfully there are separations of albums in it, making it easy for you to find the media you want. Also, in the free version, you cannot import any video of higher resolution. You need to convert them to some lower resolution for it.
