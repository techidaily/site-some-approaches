High Dynamic Range, AKA HDR, is a technique used by photographers to combine pictures of multiple exposures to create an image with perfect details. Using HDR, you can capture exactly what your eye sees.

HDR, or High Dynamic Range, photography is an excellent technique for capturing images as seen by our eyes. With this technique, you can capture the dark and light tones in the scenery.

The science behind it is that the camera captures a scene twice or thrice with different exposures. Then, it combines all the exposures and creates an image that focuses on the dark and the light tones.

There are different scenarios where HDR photography can be helpful. Especially in spaces where you have to capture the whole landscape or the true colors of the sky.

HDR technique is also useful when your camera is not up to mark and does not capture what your eye sees. In this case, you can use a software such as SNS HDR to use HDR editing to make the image as close to reality as possible.

## Review in Detail on SNS HDR

Now that you have an idea of how useful the HDR technique can be for you let's take a detailed look at SNS HDR and its features.

SNS HDR is a software for processing HDR images to create realistic shots. It uses the HDR technique to create images from a batch of photos as well as process single images. It has a wide variety of tools that help in getting natural-looking photos.

An interesting fact about SNS HDR is that it is available in three versions: SNS HDR Pro, SNS HDR Home, and SNS HDR Lite. Each of them has different licenses and provides a different set of features.

Here we are going to look at SNS HDR Pro and what features it offers.

### SNS HDR Pro’s Features

**_1\._ _Graphical User Interface_**

SNS HDR Pro has a graphical user interface that makes it really easy for users to get equipped with HDR editing. It has sliders on the right side of the screen that help you adjust different settings. It is pretty user-friendly and does not take much time to get accustomed to.

Such a user interface is beneficial for new users as they don't have to put in a lot of effort to get used to it.

**_2\._ _Batch Processing Module_**

The next feature of SNS HDR Pro is batch processing. Like most HDR software, SNS HDR Pro also offers batch processing. With the help of this feature, you can add images of multiple exposures so that the software can process them into a single HDR image.

This is helpful when you take batch photos with your camera. These photos should preferably have different exposures so that you can use SNS HDR's batch processing feature to combine all the different exposures to get a single picture with all the right tones.

**_3\._ _Built-in and User Presets_**

Another cool feature that SNS HDR Pro has is that it provides its users with built-in presets. You can use these presets by clicking on them. They are present on the left side of the screen. As the name suggests, these presets are an already constructed set of settings. When you click on them, those specific settings are applied to the image.

This is helpful as you do not have to go through the tedious task of adjusting each aspect of the image yourself. If you want to finish your editing quickly, presets are your best option.

Moreover, you can also create your own presets and save them for future use.

**_4\._ _Masks_**

Masking is another feature that SNS HDR Pro offers. Using this feature, you can edit specific parts of your image. Usually, when you add an effect, the whole picture changes according to it.

With masks, you can highlight an area of the image and edit that area solely without affecting the rest of the image.

### User Reviews

Many users worldwide have used SNS HDR Pro and given certain feedback. Among these, we have some really great photographers such Nick Powell from 360 Photography who says that

_“I have been using SNS HDR for over 2 years now and I can safely say that it is the best HDR software (in my opinion) that there is on the market today.”_

Other users have also commented on different platforms. A user Darle T. gave a review stating that

_“I like that I can use use my HDR app to fix the extreme dynamic range of my TIFFS to create a fairly dull, dynamically flat, but still realistic image.”_

Another user mentions

_“Very clean blends, natural results, good workflow, batch processing with option for manual input. Great thought-out package.”_
