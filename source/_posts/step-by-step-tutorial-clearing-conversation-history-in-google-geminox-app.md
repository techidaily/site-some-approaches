## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Clearing Conversation History in Google Geminox App

### Key Takeaways

* Deleting a conversation on Gemini is quick and easy. Just hover over the conversation, click the dots, and choose "Delete."
* To delete multiple or all Gemini chats at once, go to Gemini activity and select a time frame for deletion or turn off deletion altogether.
* You can't delete your Google Gemini account directly, but deleting all chats removes your Gemini activity connected to your Google profile.

 If you use Google Gemini (formerly Bard), each new conversation you start is saved in your chat history. So, if you want to clear this history, how can you do so? Moreover, what's the process of deleting your Gemini account altogether?

##  How to Delete a Gemini Conversation

 Deleting a single conversation in the [Google Gemini chatbot](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-master-the-art-of-gameye-and-webcam-recordings/) interface takes mere seconds. Simply hover your mouse over the conversation you want to delete, and click on the three horizontal dots that appear. Click on the "Delete" option, and confirm in the pop-up message that you wish to delete.

 Now, the chat will disappear from the sidebar. That's all there is to it!

##  How to Delete Several or All Gemini Chats at Once

 If you're looking to do a spring-clean and get rid of all your Gemini history, you'll need to first head to your Gemini activity. To do this, click on the "Activity" button at the bottom-left of the chat page.

 On this page, you'll be met with a feature named "Gemini activity", which shows you how Google is currently saving your Gemini chats. This shows how long it takes for Google to delete your chats, and how far back in your chat history you wish to delete.

 To delete all chats from a set period of time, head to "Delete" and choose what period of time you want to delete your chats from.

 Gemini lets you choose between the past hour, past day, always, or a custom time frame. If you want your chats to be deleted by default permanently, opt for "Always".

 The custom time frame allows you to set a range between two specific dates, rather than choosing your own preferred duration. For example, a month, a week, and so on.

 Alternatively, simply click the drop-down arrow next to the "Gemini Apps Activity" and choose between turning off the deletion or turning it off and deleting your activity simultaneously.

 By default, Google will save your Gemini activity and permanently delete it after 18 months, but you can change this. Click on the "Deleting activity older than" option, and you'll be able to adjust this. You can choose between three, 18, and 36 months as your auto-deletion time frame, or you can simply opt out of having your data deleted automatically.

 On the main Gemini activity page, you can also see a list of your activity history, as you would a typical browser history. There's an "X" next to each saved activity that lets you delete manually and permanently.

##  How to Delete a Google Gemini Account

 If you're not longer a fan of Gemini, or have given it a quick try and now want to delete your account, things get a little more murky. Because your Google Gemini account is directly connected to your general Google account, there's no option to delete it outright.

 If you want to remove your Google Gemini account, it's just a matter of deleting all your Gemini activity. When you sign up for a Gemini account with your Google profile, you're not supplying Google with any extra information. So, once you've deleted all your chats as shown above, you're good to go.

 Check out our guide on [deleting your Google account](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-critically-acclaimed-grabber-tech-for-2024/) if you want to wipe things entirely.

##  How Long Does Google Keep Your Chat Data?

 As we've already discussed, you can alter how long Google saves your Gemini history for in the "Gemini activity" settings. What you choose here will determine how long Google will keep your Gemini chat history.

 If you never want your chats to be deleted, you can select "Don't auto-delete history" in your Gemini activity settings.

##  Make Sure Your Gemini Settings Suit You

 If you're a frequent Gemini user, it's important to check your activity settings and ensure that Google isn't saving or deleting any data without you being aware of it. It only takes seconds to adjust your Gemini data settings, and this allows you to rest easy knowing your chat history is being handled as you'd like it to be.
