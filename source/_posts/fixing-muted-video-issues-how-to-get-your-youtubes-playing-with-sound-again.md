### Case 1: Play Online YouTube Video with Video but No Audio

Prior to one by one list out the possible reasons, I just want to remind you to check your sound track on your computer and make sure whether it's on or not, for some of us may forget to turn on your audio device on your computer. So, this is the primary step you need to do. Besides, chances are also that the YouTube videos you are playing belong to the copy protected ones. That's to say, they don't give you full access to enjoy the contents unless you pay for them or rent them and then you are allowed to watch YouTube videos with video and audio.

So far, if you are rejected by both of the aforementioned cases, then just read the following possible 4 reasons that causes the YouTube no sound issue and that's what you need. 

**1\. Sound Setting**

Apart from your computer sound track asked to check, the sound setting on your YouTube you are watching is also the one you can't ignore. After you open the YouTube videos online, check if the audio track named Mute is labeled with a symbol "X", if so, just click it and unmute the video. Sometimes, you may scratch your head, but the YouTube audio/sound not working reason is just so simple. So at times, just don't complicate the issues.

**2\. Sound Card**

There also stands a good chance that your sound hardware takes the responsibility. And chief culprit goes to your audio manager-sound card, whose breaking or crashing will definitely result in something wrong with the YouTube video that has no sound. So if you should go to examine your sound card now?

**3\. Adobe Flash Player** 

Supposed you can playback your local media files in VLC media player or Windows Media Player with sound but have YouTube sound/audio not working trouble online, then it's advisable for you to have a careful check on your Adobe Flash Player. See if your Adobe Flash Player needs to be updated to a higher level if you are still using the older version; if you should go back to your previous version of Adobe Flash Player when you cannot get any sound in YouTube only after you update your Adobe Flash Player; or make sure if there are something in your computer store required to reinstall because of certain important data missing.

\>>> YouTube best? See the sites like YouTube and make your own judgement.

**4\. Web Browser** 

Have you ever considered the possible reason of your web browser to the YouTube sound not working? Since there are numerous web browsers here to serve for you like the common Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari, etc, you guys ought to take your web browser into consideration. When you encounter the problem of YouTube no sounds in Google Chrome, then you'd better have a try on other web browsers to make clear if YouTube videos no audio happen elsewhere. If you do not hear sound or audio when playing YouTube videos in every web browser, then the first step you should go is to update your web browser or reinstall your web browser. If this doesn't work, no worries, here I give your some practical solutions worth case by case. 

![No sound/audio in YouTube videos fixed](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/web-browser.jpg)

For the fans of **Internet Explorer**, you have two solutions to fix no sound on YouTube videos problem.   
**#1:** Copy the text starting from "Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00" --> Open "Notepad" --> Paste it --> save the file as fix.reg (Attention: Don't forget the file extension .reg.) --> Double-click on fix.reg file --> Click on OK.  
**#2:** Start Menu --> Run --> Type: regedit-->In the list go to: My Computer\\ HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE \\ SO FTWARE \\ Microsoft \\ Windows NT \\ CurrentVersion \\ Drivers32 --> In the right pane, right-click --> Select new > String value --->Rename it as "wavemapper" --> Double-click it (Type: msacm32.drv) ---> Close the Registry editor.

For the buffs of **Google Chrome**, you can resolve YouTube no-audio issue by changing your audio setting (Control Panel -> Sound settings) from "5.1" to "Stereo". Alternatively, rather than change your audio settings, you can basicly run chrome.exe with --try-supported-channel-layouts command line, like below: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" --try-supported-channel-layouts. 

For the junkies of **Safari**, you can have a shot on the following method (workable for the majority, if no all): Find out System Preferences > Access to Other/ Flash Player > Advanced > Delete All --> Press the "Delete All" button --> Install Adobe Flash Player --> Quit Safari --> Restart computer and relaunch Safari. Instead of passively waiting for the expert's assistance, why not stand on your own feet to fix the YouTube no sound problem?
