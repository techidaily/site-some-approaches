_"I boutght a DVD from Southeast Asia on a trip and found it not playing on my DVD player (US). I know it restricts playback of some DVDs but how many regions are there and is there a drive that supports all regions."_

_"Whenever I try to run a DVD I get a note 'Your system is set to region 2\. to play this DVD set your system to region 4'."_

Can't play a foreign DVD due to region codes? Do you need to buy a region-free DVD player in order to play a disc from other country?

Instead of a region free DVD player, you can convert region 1/2/3/4/5/6 DVDs and unlock your DVD player region to play any DVD in U.S, Europe, China, etc.

## Part 1: What's a DVD Region Code 

[DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) region codes are a digital rights management technique created to enable motion picture studios to control the worldwide release of their movies, including content, release date and price, based upon the region. To be specific, region-free discs will play on any player, irrespective of the country. But for the region-locked DVDs, they are unplayable on the DVD player sold in other regions. 

Generally, DVDs are embedded with six major region codes, along with two additional regions reserved for other purposes. Below are the detailed geographical regions:

* R1/Region 1 - U.S.A., U.S. Territories and Canada
* R2/Region 2 - Europe, Japan, the Middle East, Egypt, South Africa, Greenland
* R3/Region 3 - Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hong Kong
* R4/Region 4 - Mexico, South and Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, Caribbean
* R5/Region 5 - Russia, Eastern Europe, India, Africa (excluding South Africa), North Korea, Mongolia
* R6/Region 6 - China

![DVD Region](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-region-world-map.png) 

DVD Region Codes

**Note**: Discs that bear region 0 (commonly referred as region free) or region all means they are uncoded and can be played worldwide. But for the PAL-formatted discs, please make sure you are using a PAL-compatible unit to play the discs. While similar to [PAL, NTSC discs](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) are playable in an NTSC-compatible unit. 

## Part 2: How to Change the Region Codes of Your DVD Player 

As it is mentioned above, DVD Players and discs are identified within a specific geographic region in the world. A DVD from region 1 is only playable in the DVD player originated from region 1\. The same is true for region 2,3,4,5 and 6\. For instance, the region 1 DVDs are only playable in DVD players purchased in the U.S. or Canada. The region 2 DVDs won't play in a standard DVD player you bought from Mexico. So it's advised to take a look at the region code on the back of the DVD package and be sure the DVD you're going to purchase is compatible with your DVD player. Consequently, for movie lovers who live in USA but want to play DVDs from Europe, Japan or countries other than those of region 1, to change the regions becomes top of priority. So how to overcome DVD region code, change DVD from region 1 to region 2 or make the DVD region free? Moving on. 

For window users, 5 times are allowed to change DVD region code as below: 

1. Click the Start menu and then Control Panel;
2. Double-click the Device Manger;
3. Click on the + near DVD/CD-ROM drives and double-click on the entry below the DVD/CD-ROM drives;
4. Click the DVD Region tab after the window opens;
5. Select the Region in which you'd like to change to and hit OK.

Note: the Region Code cannot be changed, even though the OS is reinstalled or the DVD Drive is moved to another PC. 

For Mac users, 4 more chances too to rip DVD from region to region:

1. A dialog box that urges you to choose a region for your DVD drive is opened once you insert the DVD into the optical drive on your Mac.
2. Consult the DVD package to verify the code.
3. Click Change Drive Region to and click the region code.
4. Click Set Drive Region.
5. Click on the Lock icon to save your settings.

## Part 3: How to Make Your DVD Player Region Free 

Once you have set the region in your DVD player five times, it will be locked to the last region code that you set. What can you do? You can use DVD hacks to unlock the DVD region of your DVD player. To hack a DVD player, you need to get the hack codes first. You can go to the forum videohelp to check if anyone has shared a hack code for the model of your DVD player. The steps to unlock DVD players from different manufacturers are different. Below we will show you how to hack a LG DVD player (it also works with Sony, Samsung, Panasonic DVD players):

1. Turn DVD player ON without a disc in the tray or USB stick inserted. "No Disc"should appear on the screen.
2. When the main menu appears, press the REPEAT button.
3. Next, enter a code of the region you need. For example, to unlock Samsung DVD player, the hack codes are:
4. _1 – 2 9 3 3 4 (US)_  
 _2 – 5 7 5 3 8 (Europe)_  
 _3 – 5 6 7 3 2 (South East Asia)_  
 _4 – 7 6 8 8 4 (South America)_  
 _5 – 5 3 8 1 4 (India, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Africa)_  
 _6 – 2 4 4 6 2 (China)_  
 _9 - Region Free_
5. For example, if you want to make the DVD player region free, press 9\.
6. Then turn off and on and your DVD player will now be region free.
