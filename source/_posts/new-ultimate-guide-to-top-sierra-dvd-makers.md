All of us want to use a DVD creator in order to keep those memories close. It can be a very challenging thing to do at times but it can also provide you with a very rewarding experience at the end of the day. However, it’s all about you when it comes to choosing the right tools for the trade. But since macOS Sierra made some changes to the OS architecture, some of the DVD Creators on Mac might not work anymore. This is frustrating but we have the right solution. We created a list with all those DVD burning solutions that work seamlessly on Mac

A good DVD creator and burner will help you maintain all those videos on the desired DVD media and it can definitely offer you an extraordinary and rewarding experience right from the start.

## Best 5 DVD Creators on Mac

Here you will get the 5 best and easy to use DVD burners on Mac and get lots of features with a few clicks of your mouse.

#### 1. Wondershare DVD Creator

One of the main reasons why [Wondershare DVD Creator](https://www.wondershare.com/pro/mac-dvd-creator.html) is a very good solution is that it helps you generate a stellar set of results right from the start. The application was created in order to fulfill all the needs that a person might have when it comes to creating a video and burning it the right way. It’s all about having the right convenience and using the best approach when you create and burn a DVD, something that all these apps do without a problem.

Wondershare DVD Creator has some very good features as well. For example, it enables you to burn video, photos as well as audio in just about any format that you might want. They also have a built-in editor that helps you access all the video features that you might need as fast as possible. Obviously, you can feel free to customize any thumbnail, button as well as text and frame from the DVD menu. This helps deliver a very good convenience and the results do pay off nicely. Plus, the app is one of the few that offers complete support for all Mac OS versions starting with 10.5 or later.

#### 2.DVD Cloner for Mac

[DVD Cloner for Mac](https://www.dvd-cloner.com/dvd-copy-for-mac.html) has a distinct style that makes it unique and very fast. It helps you clone your video or content DVDs in a matter of seconds and it really works amazingly well. It also manages to bring in front a truly intense value and the fact that you can use it so good is an amazing and fun experience. It’s not as comprehensive as the other tools since it doesn’t offer creation features but it does have a fast burning speed. However, the downside is that you need an external DVD burner in order to operate it if you do own a newer Macintosh computer.

#### 3.Any DVD Cloner for Mac

[Any DVD Cloner for Mac](http://www.dvdsmith.com/any-dvd-cloner-mac.html) application might be a little expensive for some at more than $35 but it’s a special and refined tool with a lot of great results and exciting features. The best thing about it is that it can easily burn compressed as well as uncompressed DVDs in less than an hour however you will need to access a physical disk if you want to create a DVD, it won’t save to ISO nor can you copy to ISO which is a downside for sure.

#### 4.Tipard DVD Cloner

[Tipard DVD Cloner](http://www.tipard.com/products-dvd-tools-mac.html) tool is designed in order to be very easy to use. The interface does show that and it helps deliver some amazing results from that thing alone. It’s really easy to use and the quality that you get is very well worth it for sure. Obviously, investing in a good tool also requires a good burning time and unfortunately Tipard DVD Cloner is one of the slowest burners out there. Still, it’s a good investment although it can go over $40 when it comes to the price so it really isn’t that cheap to begin with.

#### 5.Express Burn

[Express Burn](http://www.nch.com.au/burn/index.html) is created by NCH software and it’s one of the tools that delivers a very good Mac DVD burning speeds out there. It’s a great tool for those that want to duplicate the home DVDs however it doesn’t have the ability to decrypt commercial DVDs. It’s a downside for sure especially since the product is one of the most expensive ones out there at around $80\. Still, if you don’t mind the price it can make for a good DVD burner although it really is expensive.

As a whole, you can get some great DVD burners without a problem. All you have to do is to take your time and be creative because results will always pay off. Take your time and test out all these DVD burners on Mac as you are bound to find one that suits your needs.
