DVD Shrink is a good option to copy and compress a DVD into a smaller size. And it can remove some basic DVD copy protection schemes, including DVD region codes, CSS copy protection, and user operation prohibitions. So some Mac users wonder if they can install DVD Shrink on Mac. The short answer is No.

There is still no macOS version of DVD Shrink, and the development was discontinued in May 2005\. But luckily, there are some useful alternatives to DVD Shrink that can work on Mac.

##  No.1: MacX DVD Ripper Pro

Latest version: 6.8.2 | January 10, 2024  
 OS Support: macOS (macOS 14 included) and Windows 11/10   
 Licence: Free to try | One-Year Subscription / 3 Macs: $34.95; Lifetime License / 1 Mac: $59.95 

[**MacX DVD Ripper Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is the best alternative to DVD Shrink on Mac for handling different protected DVDs. It's able to **copy** DVDs to ISO, Video\_TS Folder, MKV, or MPG with all extras, subtitles and audio tracks in **100% original quality**, as well as rip DVDs to MP4, MOV, HEVC, M4V, AVI, WMV, FLV, as well as iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Android, and **350+** profiles. 

It can compress a DVD more efficiently than DVD Shrink. There is an efficient compression engine to compress a DVD (7.5GB) to a digital file (less than 1GB), with no key frame drops or pixilation.

 It's a more powerful DVD Shrink for Mac program to **remove** the DVD copy protections. Different from DVD Shrink, it doesn't need extra tools to copy DVDs with CSS encryption, AACS 2.0, RCE region protections, ARccOS copy protection, Disney 99 titles, and more. It runs about **5x faster** than DVD Shrink to rip a DVD to MP4 with advanced GPU (Intel QSV/AMD/Nvidia) hardware acceleration.

##  No.2: MacTheRipper

Latest version: 5.0.0.3 | Aug 5, 2015  
 OS Support: Mac OS X (except Mountain Lion)  
 Licence: Free (before version 2.6.6)|$40.00

[MacTheRipper](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is another free DVD-Shrink alternative for Mac that should not be overlooked! It can save your commercial DVD movies as in ISO Image or VOB files on your hard drive. When backing up DVD movies, it did compress the DVD size, but at a lower compression ratio than any other DVD Shrink for Mac alternatives. 

Third-party software is needed to substantially reduce the DVD size by converting VOB to MP4, MOV, M4V. As far as I can tell that MacTheRipper is an easy and fast alternative in aspect of copying DVD without too much compression. 

![DVD Shrink Mac alternative - MacTheRipper](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/mtr-700.jpg)

##  No.3: RipIt

Latest version: 1.6.9 | Aug 12, 2015  
 OS Support: Mac OS X(Yosemite/El Capitan)  
 Licence: Free to try | $ 24.95

Another similar program like DVD Shrink comes to RipIt. It's known for its ease of use and powerful decrypting feature, which is even better than Handbrake and Mac The Ripper. RipIt offers two methods for backing up DVDs to Mac: ripping DVDs, which copies everything to the Mac, including movie extras, subtitles, and alternate audio tracks for playback on DVD players, and compressing DVDs, which produces a smaller video file that you can export to iTunes and sync to an iPod, iPhone, or iPad. 

The second way reduced the DVD size greatly, and to some degree, achieved the equivalent effect of DVD Shrink for Mac. Furthermore, copying a DVD on a Mac usually takes about a half hour. It will take longer to compress a disc.

##  No.4\. Handbrake

Latest version: 1.7.2 | December 24, 2023   
 OS Support: macOS, Windows, Linux   
 Licence: Free 

Handbrake may work as a free DVD Shrink for Mac alternative when you need to convert a DVD. It offers no DVD copying or authoring ability, but it's very popular for converting a DVD to MKV, MP4, WebM formats, and presets for some Android, Apple, TV devices, etc. There are different filters and settings to help compress a DVD to a smaller video. In addition, there are different GPU and software encoders to allow users to rip a DVD at the speed or quality they want. 

While DVD Shrink has a DeCSS decryption algorithm to handle DVD copy protections, this Mac alternative doesn't. Handbrake only supports non-protected DVDs. Extra [libdvdcss](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is needed to help Handbrake rip DVDs with region codes and CSS. 

![Free DVD Shrink Mac alternative- HandBrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/hb-start-700.jpg) 

##  No.5\. MakeMKV

Latest version: 1.17.6 | January 20, 2024   
 OS Support: macOS, Windows, Linux  
 Licence: Free for 60 days | $ 50

MakeMKV is a simple and powerful DVD converter. It's capable of creating a copy of an entire DVD or Blu-ray disc and converting it to MKV. It supports DVDs and Blu-ray discs protected by common copy protections such as  AACS and BD+. No additional software is required for conversion or decryption. However, unlike DVD Shrink, you cannot shrink the DVD to a smaller size. The output format is MKV, which is about the same size as a DVD. So when you use this DVD Shrink alternative on Mac, make sure you have enough free space on the hard drive. 

MakeMKV is free with full functions for the first 60 days. Then it will stop working and you will need to purchase it. However, you can always download the latest version and use it for free. Free download the DVD Shrink alternative on Mac, then you can extract and save a DVD into MKV.

**Note:** If you want to download free open-source software such as DVD Shrink, MacTheRipper, RipIt, and others, you should go to their official website first. As DVD Shrink says on its official webpage, there are varied types of scams like DVD Shrink 2014, Official DVD Shrink, DVD Shrink Gold 2011, etc. Check its legitimacy before you download those freeware for DVD decrypting and ripping.
