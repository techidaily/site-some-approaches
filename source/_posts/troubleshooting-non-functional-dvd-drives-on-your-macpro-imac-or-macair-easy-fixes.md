Generally, there are many reasons leading to DVD not playing issues on Mac. You have to make certain of the exact reason and then fix the problem when your Mac refuses to play DVD accordingly. 

1\. DVD is dirty, smudged or scratched. This is the major reason why your Mac DVD player ejects DVD, though your drive accepts it. If your DVD disc is susceptible to accident damage and dust, please repair scratched DVD if not seriously hurted. 

2\. The actual DVD drive lens is dirty, which will particularly affect dual-layer discs. Or your SuperDrive is bad or damaged.

3\. macOS upgrade often results in system problem, and Mac won't play DVD issue is of no exception. 

4\. Software Update is to blame for "iMac won't play DVD" problem.[See fixes to macOS update problems](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macxdvd.com%2Fmac%2Fhow-to-update-macos.htm).
