## Streaming Services App Investigation Findings

An excellent video editor and movie maker made especially for Android and iOS users. Earning its name in the market due to its friendly interface and highly advanced features, VideoShow is doubtlessly now one of the best mobile phone video editing applications. However, for advanced video editing, you must purchase their premium version.

| **Advantages**                  | **Disadvantages**                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easily understandable interface | It is necessary to share personal data with the application             |
| Advanced editing tools          | Annoying ads in the free version                                        |
| Android and iOS compatibility   | You will frequently push up ads asking you to buy their premium version |
| A free version is available     | Some of its limitations in the free version are very undesired          |

## Part 1\. What is VideoShow Video Editor App?

VideoShow video editor is currently the best option for those who want to edit their videos professionally with much less effort. It has all the updated editing tools which any mobile video editor should have.

**Download:** You can download this application for Android and iOS: [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xvideostudio.videoeditor&hl=en&gl=US) **|** [**iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/videoshow-video-editor-maker/id930380089)

**Price:** Like many other mobile video editing applications, VideoShow video editor also has a premium version which you can purchase. However, you can still use it free using its free version and edit your videos. But it has a few limitations like you have to face annoying ads and bear their watermark on your video. And you cannot access some highly advanced editing tools as well.

## Part 2\. Key features of the VideoShow Video Editor App

Now lets us discuss some of its key features as well.

### Various audio effects

VideoShow video editor has various sound effects in its library, like Minions, little girl, taking tom and monster, etc., from which you can easily choose one of your choices. They can help make the audio of your videos fascinating for the viewers. Moreover, you can adjust the settings of these audio effects by yourself, but for that purpose, you must buy their premium version first.

### Pre-Prepared Templates

It also has a great collection of pre-prepared templates, which can be very helpful in making awesome videos very quickly. The best thing about this feature in VideoShow is that it does not require any premium subscription from you. All the templates are available for free and without any ads. You can use a template according to the aspect ratio of your video.

### Amazing Filters

The VideoShow application also has a unique and exciting collection of filters you can use in your videos. However, some popular filters are only available in their paid version, but still, in their free version, there are also many filter options for you.

### Live Dubbing

Its live dubbing feature allows you to dub your videos by watching them on your screen. So it will surely be a beneficial feature for those dubbing their videos for the first time. Moreover, you can also make your music video using it.

### Special effects

This feature of the VideoShow video editor enables you to add some special effects to your videos. There is an entirely separate library of these effects from which you can select which one you want to use. However, not all these effects are accessible in the free version. Some requires paid version as well.

## Part 3\. How to use VideoShow Video Editor App?

Now that we know about it, we will discuss how we can use it.

### Import

First, click on the video edit button to import your media files to the VideoShow video editor. Then it will take you to a menu where all your mobile's media will appear. You can select the media you want to import and click on the add button. The flaws in its importing are that it cannot separate your media in such a way that your pictures and videos are in different sections. However, thankfully there are separations of albums in it, making it easy for you to find the media you want. Also, in the free version, you cannot import any video of higher resolution. You need to convert them to some lower resolution for it.

### Filters

You can use filters by clicking on the filters option, which will be at the bottom of your screen. Then it will take you to its filter library, where you can choose the filter of your choice. And then, click on the Tick button to apply that filter to your video. Some filters are free, and for some, you must purchase their premium package.

### Stickers

You can add different stickers to your video using it as well. For this purpose, you have to select the sticker's option from the bottom menu of it. A library will open from which you can choose them. After choosing your favorite stickers, click the Apply the changes button at the top right corner.

### Speed adjustment

Its speed adjustment feature is also not less than any of the above, as it can help you to make your video slow or fast. It will surely provide you with a cinematic effect. To use this feature, you must click the Edit button. Then you have to click on the Clip edit option and then the speed option. A setting will appear from which you can easily adjust your video's speed. It is a free feature. It does not require any premium package from you.

### Export

Now you click on the export button at the top right of your screen for this. After that, a menu asks which resolution you want to export your content. Only those who use a free version of the software can export videos at SD resolution. You must then select the "save to gallery" option after selecting the video resolution and frame rate.

### Disadvantages

Some of its disadvantages are the following:

#### **Export Quality:**

You can only export your video in SD quality using a free version. To export it in HD, FHD, and 4K resolution, you must purchase the premium version of it. Moreover, you cannot select the frame rate above 30 in the free version.

#### **Paid features:**
