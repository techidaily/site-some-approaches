| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easily understandable interface | It is necessary to share personal data with the application             |
| Advanced editing tools          | Annoying ads in the free version                                        |
| Android and iOS compatibility   | You will frequently push up ads asking you to buy their premium version |

The best thing about this feature in VideoShow is that it does not require any premium subscription from you. All the templates are available for free and without any ads. You can use a template according to the aspect ratio of your video.

### Amazing Filters

The VideoShow application also has a unique and exciting collection of filters you can use in your videos. However, some popular filters are only available in their paid version, but still, in their free version, there are also many filter options for you.

### Live Dubbing

Its live dubbing feature allows you to dub your videos by watching them on your screen. So it will surely be a beneficial feature for those dubbing their videos for the first time. Moreover, you can also make your music video using it.

## Part 3\. How to use VideoShow Video Editor App?

Now that we know about it, we will discuss how we can use it.

### Import

First, click on the video edit button to import your media files to the VideoShow video editor. Then it will take you to a menu where all your mobile's media will appear. You can select the media you want to import and click on the add button. The flaws in its importing are that it cannot separate your media in such a way that your pictures and videos are in different sections. However, thankfully there are separations of albums in it, making it easy for you to find the media you want. Also, in the free version, you cannot import any video of higher resolution. You need to convert them to some lower resolution for it.
