## The Art of Discrete Audio Erosion in Audacity

Free, open-source freeware for Windows and Mac, Audacity, is a powerful toolkit to Fade Audacity. You could wish to employ the common music production method of fading songs in and out of your podcast using Audacity fade. To make an engaging and deeper podcast, it's helpful to understand how to slightly fade out the music so that it plays in the background but still makes it easy to hear the spoken track. There are a few ways to do this.

You can easily apply professional fades to your audio files with Audacity fade out effect. The audio in the chosen portion will progressively get quieter when the fade out effect is applied, ending in stillness. The fade out tool is nearly totally automated, making it simple and understandable for both novices and experts. Along with the other several tools under Audacity's Effects menu, the fade out tool may be found there.

## Part 1\. Linear Fade in/out

You may apply linear fades, a straightforward fade option, to any segment of your music. Alternatively, you might apply it to the full audio file. Linear fades come in two varieties. Fade-in and Fade-out are the two varieties. Any section of your audio that you apply a fade-in to will get muted and return to its original volume. Additionally, if you activate the fade-out feature in your audio, the audio will transition from its original volume to total quiet.

### **Steps to Use Linear Fade in/out:**

To divide a track into several parts so you may apply a fade to a specific audio segment, press Cmd + I (or Ctrl + I).

In this example, we divided the clip at the eight-second mark and used the Time Shift tool to shift the second chunk to the new location.

By selecting the audio segment, you wish to fade out and selecting Effect > Fade Out, you may add a fade-out to the initial clip.

## Part 2\. Studio Fade Out

This effect is shown by Audacity as a curve that resembles the letter S. It results in a very gentle fading. After the first boom, there is utter quiet. It's a sound that actually gives off the impression of fading away over time. Using the repeat last effect, you can quickly repeat this fading option. Additionally, Ctrl + R serves as the shortcut for the same.

### **How to Use Studio Fade Out:**

Choose your audio segment, go to the Effect menu, slide to the bottom, and pick Studio Fade Out to apply the effect.

## Part 3\. Adjustable Fade

A dialog box will show up on the screen when you choose the customizable fade option. You may customize the form and pattern of the fading using that dialog box. You may use this ability to make partial fades if you'd like. You must maintain the tracks stacked one on top of the other with the lower track underneath the higher track and its end overlapping when employing this form of fade.

### **Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:**

* Select Effect from the menu.
* Select the variable fading option.

## Part 4\. Crossfades Audacity

There are two choices available when using this effect. You have two options: either manually make a crossfade of your own, or utilize one of the pre-existing crossfades in Audacity. In Audacity, there are two crossfades that are accessible. Crossfade clips and Crossfade tracks are what they are. Crossfade clips make it easier to switch between two distinct clips. Additionally, crossfade tracks aid in crossfading between two audio tracks and are more exact.

### **Steps to Use Crossfades:**

Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track.

Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect > Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you've chosen.

![crossafade audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossafade-audio-with-audacity.jpg)

Use your Selection tool to organize the clips such that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect > Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.

## Part 5\. Alternative Way to Fade Audio

Even though it's still thought of as difficult, time-consuming work, audio editing is really pretty easy with the correct program or tool.
