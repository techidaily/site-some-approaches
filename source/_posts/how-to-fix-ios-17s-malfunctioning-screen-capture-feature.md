### 7\. iPad Air Cannot Activate Screen Recording on iOS 17

The list of iOS 17 supported devices is a mile long. Among so many devices, iPad Air users post iOS 17 screen recording not working problems most, up to 90% rate of breakdown. Here we also collect the survey data on other iOS 17 supported devices. You can have a clear overview about the rate of breakdown on different models of iPhone iPad.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
On one hand, the potential reason might be the iPad Air hardware configuration. You see, the 9.7-inch iPad Air sports with A7 processor chip, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone and 1 GB RAM internal memory. These hardware configurations in iPad Air seem too low for recording screen videos on iOS 17\. On the other hand, the hearsay indicates that this might be related with Apple marketing strategy. Each iOS update would cause some iOS bugs, and more often these iOS bugs happen on older iPads iPhones. That's because Apple wants you to [upgrade to new iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). As for iPad series, Apple encourages you to upgrade to iPad Pro in a silent way. No matter which one is the real reason, you can follow the tips and tricks to solve it. 

1. Backup iPad files to Mac/PC or iCloud and then reset iPad settings to factory settings.
2. Spend some money to upgrade A7 chip to A9X chip or upgrade iPad Air internal memory (this service is available in some countries, not all).
3. Download free alternative to iOS 17 screen recording to record iPad Air screen with 3rd party screen recorder app.
4. Upgrade to iPad Pro with A9X chip, Dual-core 2.26 GHz and 4GB RAM internal memory, not only for screen recording, but also for better user experience.

### 8\. Cannot Upload Recorded Screen Videos to YouTube

You successfully record iOS 17 iPhone iPad screen video and save on Photo apps and think eventually this tough task is over. Yet, the cruel truth is that it's not finished. 

When you wanna upload recorded funny screen video to YouTube for sharing, you're told that your video can't be uploaded to YouTube. Why and how? Read on:

**Reasons:**

1. Recorded video is too long, above 15 minutes or HD video is more than 10 minutes.
2. iOS 17 screen recorded video is too large in size, 2GB+.
3. iPhone iPad screen recorded video is formatted with HEVC (H265), which is not supported by YouTube currently.

![fix iOS 17 screen recording YouTube upload error](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/ios-11-screen-recording-bug-8.jpg) 

**Solution:**

Use free iPhone video converter - [MacX Video Converter Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to free convert iPhone iPad HEVC video to MP4 (H264/MPEG-4), AVI, FLV, MOV, WMV, WebM, 3GP, etc. YouTube supported video formats and other 180+ video and 14+ audio formats. Plus, it can also trim iPhone video to shorten video length and adjust video resolution to compress video size with 30% - 90% file size off.
