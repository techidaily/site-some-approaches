 There is no doubt to say that GoPro is one of the best action camera manufacturers that ensures impressive video quality with very high resolutions. But the only trouble that users face with GoPro models is their short battery life. If you connect it more with remote or keep your screen ON most of the times, then battery will start decaying fast. If you opt for high resolution recording and are using Wi-Fi connectivity at the same time then your device will suffer significant decay in battery percentage. Professional's advice is to keep spare batteries as well as additional charger with you during long tours so that your device can always stay ready to capture beautiful moments.
