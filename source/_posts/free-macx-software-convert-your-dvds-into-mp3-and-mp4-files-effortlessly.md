I really love this software. Everything else rips great. Perfect for ripping DVD's to MP4 format and then at a later transfer to iPad at your leisure. I'm pleased so far. I've tried a few tests in various DVD even the copy protected DVD with success. I ripped a whole 90 minute video with no problem and was able to successfully use subtitles. Thanks again!
