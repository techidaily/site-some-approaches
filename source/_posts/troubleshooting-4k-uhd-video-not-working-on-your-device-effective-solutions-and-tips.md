### Method 2\. Compress 4K Videos

If your computer hardware, graphics card, monitor, iOS or Android phone, or tablet does not play 4K videos in 2160p, but you are not planning to update it, you need to [compress 4K video to 1080p](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), 720p, or lower resolution to solve the Ultra HD 4K video movie won't play problem. 4K video file size is quite large, which will also lead to Ultra HD 4K video not playing, 2160P 4K video not loading, black screen, 4K video playback lagging, 4K video crashing while playing, etc. issue. You can simply [reduce the 4K video file size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) by simply lowering the 4K video resolution, and adjusting the frame rate or bit rate.
