However, there are a few limitations regarding it if you are using the free version: you can only export videos for up to five minutes.

### Primary Editing

As we discussed earlier, you can use almost all the essential editing tools, whether using a free or a premium version. You can quickly get all these tools at the bottom of your mobile's screen.
