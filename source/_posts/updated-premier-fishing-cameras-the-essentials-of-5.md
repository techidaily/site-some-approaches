## What makes a good fishing action camera?

A good action camera must offer easy controls, built in Wi-Fi connectivity and longer battery life. The article below will help you to get some idea about five top fishing action cameras in market as per your feature preferences.

**Easy to Access Buttons:** These buttons assist users in immediate switching between camera activities and its modes. No matter whether you have mounted it on pole or on your hat, simply press the control buttons and it will process desired function.

**Resolution and FPS:** The biggest requirement of every fishing lover is to have a camera that can provide higher resolution. It must be even able to capture water droplets very clearly. Full HD or 4K resolution is often desired along with higher frame rate of the range 60fps or 120 fps.

**Memory and Storage:** A fishing action camera should not ace lack of storage so users often wish to get a device that supports 32 GB or [more memory space](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
