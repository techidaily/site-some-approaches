_MacXDVD Software today released MacX MediaTrans V3.3, extending its supported coverage to iTunes contents. The upgrade makes it possible to backup movies, TV shows, music, songs, audiobooks from iTunes store to Mac in normal MP4 and MP3 files, thus making them accessible to non-Apple devices. Plus, the latest version makes it the first data transfer software for Mac users to delete photos from iPhone's camera roll list._ 

MacXDVD Software today announces that its upgraded [MacX MediaTrans](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) V3.3 has reached to new heights with the unique support for iTunes items and world's first solution for Mac users to delete camera roll photos. Purpose-built to ease the media transfer between iDevices and Mac, MacXDVD's helper is now further optimized to support exporting iPhone iPad purchases, e.g. movies, TV Shows, music and Audiobooks directly from iTunes Store for computer or non-apple devices, and bulk deleting all photos from camera roll in one click, for the first time. 

The world's leading iPhone manager is available for Mac computers and notebooks running on macOS Sierra or earlier versions, and supports all iOS 10.3/9/8/7 powered iDevices. Freely manage iTunes contents and iPhone photos with the full version at <https://www.macxdvd.com/mediatrans/>.

A recent survey conducted by PayPal indicates that iTunes still tops the chart when it comes to purchasing music, movies and TV shows. The increasing investments in iTunes and larger storage demands on iDevices are asking for an easy way to save these iTunes items. MacXDVD answers the longstanding complaint by adding the first-of-its-kind iTunes backup capabilities in its unmatched [iPhone file manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

**First iPhone Manager on the Market to Support iTunes Contents**

With full support for M4V movies, music videos, TV shows, clips, M4P music, songs and audio books from iTunes, to free up more space on iDevices and protect users' purchases is nothing difficult now. iTunes data on iPhone, iPad Pro/Air 2/ and other [iOS 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) powered devices can be transferred to iMac, Macbook Pro/Air, Mac Mini, etc in widely-used MP4 and MP3 formats without the need to share the same Apple ID and password or connect to the same home network. The exported MP4 and MP3 is readily compatible with other video players and Android, Google and Windows mobiles.

**Mass Delete All Photos from iDevices' Camera Roll on Mac**

The V3.3 upgrade also marks MacX MediaTrans as the world's first one-click solution for Mac users to bulk delete all or multiple photos from camera roll and other albums. The clunky one-by-one deleting now becomes obsolete forever. Deleting photos by "All", by "Month" or other types in one shot can be flexibly realized when iPhone needs more room. Plus, new album categories, namely Screenshots, Selfies, Bursts and Panorama are added for easier iPhone photos management.

**To be specific, MacX MediaTrans offers great help if users need to:**  
\* Manage iPhone music library and create ringtones;  
\* Backup iDevices photos and transfer wallpapers;
