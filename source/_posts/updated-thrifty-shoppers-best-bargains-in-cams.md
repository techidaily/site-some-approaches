## What to consider when choosing a cheap action camera?

 Some of the most useful features and specifications that you need to check before making decision to buy any action camera are listed as below:

* **Extra accessories:** Sometimes you may get camera at cheap price but then you will have to spend more on its accessories. As you cannot operate these cameras without their supporting system so it becomes essential to check the accessory kit price at the time of purchase. Prefer to buy a camera that provides all basic accessories with the box.
* **Resolution:** The major problem of maximum cameras is their poor resolution and picture clarity especially when they are mounted on helmet or moving objects. Try to ensure resolution of at least 1080p or prefer to find one with 4K quality.
* **Memory Capacity:** Few latest models never allows users to insert [memory card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for storage, you have to compromise with the limited internal storage only. Be aware while buying such cameras, it is necessary to have at least 32 GB storage space for better results.
* **Battery:** A camera unit with non removable battery is of no use because it cannot assist you in long tours. One must get a device with removable and [rechargeable batteries](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) so that it can serve you beyond any time limit.
