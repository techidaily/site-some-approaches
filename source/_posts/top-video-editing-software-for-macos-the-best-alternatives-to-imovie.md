![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/tip3.png) **macXvideo is easier than iMovie**

macXvideo is immodestly the easiest alternative to iMovie. Though iMovie is suggested as the simplest video editor for Mac, beginners still need time to get started. Other editors on this list will require even more daunting editing skills. macXvideo blends the useful features into the most intuitive interface. It siginficantly decreases the efforts required to make an amazing movie. Even the most novice users can get started editing immediately.

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/tip3.png) **macXvideo is better than iMovie dealing 4K** 

iMovie didn't take up 4K until V10.1\. It's not an expert. When you [edit videos using iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) in 4K resolution, like videos recorded by GoPro, iPhone X, DJI drones etc, users easily run into folowing situations:

1. 4K editing in iMovie is choppy and stuck, it takes too long to get back;
2. "edit a video (4K from my iPhone) iMovie is ok, but after adding more clips and or specially title or transition, computer starts to heat up";
3. "The maximum export resolution is 1080P, I can't get a 4K from iMovie".

Video editing is an intensive task. 4K UHD, which has more data and is often encoded in more complex HEVC h.265, AV1 or VP9, asks for more CPU power. In other words, if you do need to edit 4K videos on iMovie, or other more advanced editors like Final Cut Pro, Adobe, your computer needs to be strong, or you will experience choppy editing or overheating.

Designed for 4K videos, macXvideo can edit 4K Ultra HD videos far better and faster than iMovie. This free alternative to iMovie is the only free video editor on the market that applies the major hardware acceleration (namely Intel QSV, Nvidia Cuda/NVENC, AMD) in the whole video editing process. Compared to iMovie which only uses GPU to render the interface and other effects in editing, it accelerates the whole video editing, from decoding, encoding, compressing to editing, to **5x faster than iMovie**. Meanwhile, by offloading the video process tasks to the specialized graphics processing unit (GPU), common video editing problems like freezing or overheating are removed.

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/tip3.png)**macXvideo offers better compression than iMovie**

With iMovie, users has no control on the output size. It has been a long-term problem that iMovei projects are way big. macXvideo allows flexible control on how big you want the final project to be. There are a variety of options to freely adjust the file size freely by tweaking the video/audio settings freely, like the video codecs, resolution, sample rate, frame rate, bit rate, quality. More importantly, it has a unique compression engine, which is developed based on the characteristics of 4K ultra HD videos. Namely, it's purpose-built to [reduce the huge file size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and keep the sharpness. It has been proved to offer **90% size reduction with 98% original quality**.

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/../seoimage/tip3.png) **macXvideo has wider format support than iMovie**

Not all the videos can be accepted by iMovie, including some common formats like MKV, AVI, WMV, MTS (check full list of [iMovie formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)). To edit those videos on iMovie, there is an extra convert step - you need to convert the incompatible videos into iMovie formats (BTW, macXvideo also serves as a video transcoder). With 370+ video codecs, you can import any videos into macXvideo that iMovie doesn't.

iMovie exports are limited to YouTube, Vimeo, FaceBook, Email, iTunes. If you want to upload projects to websites or send to friends, the options are quite useful. If you need to save iMovei projects in format you want, iMovie doesn't provide much freedom. In this respect, macXvideo also provides more choices. You can export the project to 4k hevc, mp4, mov, avi, mkv, mp3 etc for freely upload to online sites, emails, or mobiles.
