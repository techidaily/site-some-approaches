## Upgraded Multitasking with Microsoft's Multi-Display Feature in Edge

Picture-in-Picture is an important feature on Windows and Android computers. It allows you to watch videos while they float on the screen of your desktop or smartphone. Microsoft Edge has PIP on Android and all other platforms to enable you to float videos on your screen on mini mode. And you can watch them as you perform other tasks on different apps and programs.

## Part 1\. How to Enable and Disable Picture in Picture in Edge

To exploit the PIP mode on your desktop computer, there are simple steps to follow to achieve this. And once you are in PIP mode, you can turn it off at your convenience.

### Turn on PIP

You can turn on PIP on Microsoft Edge using four different methods.

1. Using PIP Button
2. By Using Global Media Control
3. By installing Picture in Picture Extension on Microsoft Edge
4. Right-click on a playing video

I will discuss two of the methods: Using the PiP Button and Right-click on the Video.

To enable PiP in edge on your desktop computer using the button, there are cheap 5 steps to follow right here.

1. Start Microsoft Edge on your PC and click the **3 dots** in the top right corner
2. Go to **Settings > Cookies and Site Permissions**
3. Go to **Picture in Picture Control**
4. Go to **Show Picture in Picture Control inside Video Frame** and turn on the button.
5. Resize the floating window to your favorite size and drag it to the position you like on the screen

And here is a simple step-by-step procedure to follow to turn on PiP on your PC by right-clicking on the video.

1. Start Microsoft Edge on your computer
2. Visit any site where you want to play your video from
3. Start the video
4. Move your mouse over the video and right-click twice on it.
5. Select Picture in Picture on the new menu so that Edge adds the video as a floating window on your screen.

![right click on the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-pip-on-microsoft-edge-2.jpg)

You can drag and move the floating window around the screen and drop it at any location that you want with your mouse. And you can also resize that video so that it gives you a large space to proceed with other activities.

### Turn off PIP

Even after turning on PiP on your desktop, you can still decide to switch off the PiP button on Microsoft Edge on your computer. And here is how to do it.

1. Launch the Microsoft Edge browser on your computer.
2. Let it open and click the **Hamburger icon (the 3-Bars icon)** in the top right corner of the App to access the Application Menu.
3. Go to **Settings>Cookies and Site Permissions**
4. Go to **Picture in Picture Control.**
5. Click Switch off for **Show Picture-In-Picture Control inside Video Frame**.

![click switch off](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-pip-on-microsoft-edge-3.jpg)

Once you follow the steps above, you will be able to manipulate the PIP feature on your computer to use it as you like.

## Part 2\. Useful Add-ons for PiP on Edge

There are simpler ways to access and exploit Picture in Picture on your PC. Some supplement shortcut utilities that can enable you to enjoy this feature with ease are here.

### [PIP - Picture in Picture Plus](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/pip-picture-in-picture-/gokdpnhaggoioddclnnlpjfnkdinjjcc)

The keyboard shortcut for PiP mode is **Alt + P**. Just click **Alt + P** and you are ready to go. This feature applies to YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.

2. Click on the extension icon
3. Select Picture in Picture

And you are ready to go.

### [Picture in Picture - PIP View](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/picture-in-picture-pip-/ebkloopllebgbjeppnncbekpfcglbcmp?hl=en-US)

PIP View is an add-on in Microsoft Edge that eases up the use of Picture in Picture on your PC. It is based on manifest V3 and performs well for players in an iframe.

![pip view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-pip-on-microsoft-edge-5.jpg)

PIP View is an extension that is available on all websites with HTML video element. It is a crucial feature on YouTube that helps you save with Picture in Picture mode. On YouTube, it is added just next to the Settings in the app, and it allows you to float your video easily across the screen.

### [Picture-in-Picture Everywhere](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/pictureinpicture-everyw/cmnlinjalaieggoebkmamaphjghpafhn?hl=en-US)

This is a feature that enables you to use picture in picture on any site that you love. You can use Picture-in-Picture on your TV and Movies app anytime at any place.
