## The Artisan's Approach to Color Balancing

Color grading is a post-production process common to filmmaking and video editing that improves image appearance for presentation in different environments on different devices. Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.

## Part 1\. What is color grading?

Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by "painting" over what you've created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot â€“ emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.

Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film's carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, [_American Beauty (1999)_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/) uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas [_Maleficent (2014)_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/) uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.
