**Greater Control:** With a desktop video editor, you have greater control over the final product. This is because you can fine-tune every video aspect, from the frame rate to the audio levels.

**Easier To Use:** Desktop video editors are typically more straightforward to use than mobile apps. This is because they have a larger screen to work on and a more robust interface.
