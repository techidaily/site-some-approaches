## What is HEVC \- How HEVC/H.265 Differs from H.264 and VP9



_The evolving video compression makes it possible to watch hundreds of channels nowadays since videos can be compressed small enough. And HEVC sets the milestone in the big step forward towards compression tech._ 

_Now comes the question: What is HEVC codec? How much do you know about it? Can you differ HEVC/H.265 codec from H.264, AV1 or other video coding formats? How to play HEVC? If you want to dig further into HEVC codec, this post lines up to offer you everything about HEVC._

HEVC is short for High Efficiency Video Coding, which is also known as H.265\. The new video compression standard substantially improves the data compression ratio for videos, thus saving a massive bandwidth and ensuring a 50% bit rate reduction at the same level of video quality.

 Besides, videos encoded with H.265 take up less space than H.264\. Or you can say H.265/HEVC enables greatly improved video quality at the same bit rate compared with H.264\. To customers, they can watch high-definition TV shows, 3D Blu Ray and even high-quality [4K/8K videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)online smoothly. 

## How to Play 4K/8K HEVC Videos without Downloading HEVC Codec

HEVC requires high on computer hardware. This makes it troublesome when playing 4K/oversized video with HEVC codec. MacX Video Converter Pro comes as the best HEVC converter with GPU acceleration that is able to fast convert 4K/8K HEVC video to/from H.264 for more smooth playback on your Mac, iPhone, iPad and other mobile devices.

## Why Use HEVC/H.265 for 4K/8K Videos Instead of H.264 

[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4%5FAVC), the predecessor of HEVC, is famous for compressing huge amount of information of a video for steaming over YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, etc. Those videos from the video streaming services are generally in 1080p (2.1 megapixels) or 720p (0.9 megapixels). But for the 4k video with 8.3 megapixels, it seems to be impossible to store or transmit the UHD video if compressed with H.264\. Due to the less efficiency in video compression with H.264, coding distortion situations are likely to happen in border areas. 

HEVC/H.265 codec manages to offer the same level of video quality but half the size of video compared to its successor H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, which means these 4K contents need only half the data to stream over YouTube. The size of code unit is determined by the regional information. Plus, the quality of video encoded by HEVC is substantially enhanced under the same bit rate. That That's way HEVC is widely used to compress video with 4K or even 8K resolution. 

## HEVC/H.265 VS H.264, AV1 or Other Video Codecs

**1\. HEVC vs H.264**: Since HEVC or H.265 is the successor to avc H.264, there is bound to be a comparison between [HEVC/H.265 and H.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). So how does HEVC or H.265 advantages over H.264? Still here, just scroll down for the answer. 

**Approved date**: The first version of H.264 was standardized in 2003 while HEVC was formally ratified as a standard 10 years later. 

**Size**: H.265/HEVC reduces the file size by about 39-44% at the same quality compared to H.264\. That means, If you download HEVC MKV movie in 4K with 2hr in length, you will get around around 1.25-1.5GB compared with the same movie with 3GB encoded by H264\. 

**Bit rate**: With the use of HEVC/H.265 codec, bit rate savings are reported to be 50% or more compared to H.264, which is proven at the 2012 Mobile World Congress. Meanwhile, the H.264 reportedly showed almost 50% bit rate reduction compared to MPEG-2 Part 2\. 

**Availability**: H.264 is available to deliver HD sources (1080p/720p) for broadcast and online. While better than [H.264, X265](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), H.265/HEVC is likely to implement Ultra HD, 2k, 4k and even 8K for broadcast and online. 

![HEVC vs H.264](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/h264-vs-h265.png)

**2\. HEVC vs AV1**: AOMedia's AV1 is backed by the world's leading companies incl. Google, Apple, Intel, etc. The open source yet royalty-free codec is supposed to be the biggest rival of HEVC. Despite HEVC is reported to deliver a 50% gain in compression efficiency over H.264 and VP8 standards while maintaining the same video quality, AV1 performs well in compression and is proven to save 51% when compared to X264 by Facebook. 

**Bit rate**: HEVC/H.265 provides a bit rate saves of over 43% compared to H.264\. While AV1 achieved 50.3% higher data compression than x264 main profile. From this point of view, AV1 is roughly on par with HEVC. While at the same time, AV1 is a free codec, unencumbered by license fees, which is a strong motivation for advancing an alternative to HEVC. 

**Quality**: HEVC is delivering on its promise of higher visual quality pictures at the same bitrates. While the AV1 has equal quality as compared to HEVC. 

**Browser compatibility**: HEVC playback is supported in DivX while VP9 has the advantages unsurprisingly, with support in Google Chrome and Firefox. Now AV1 plays in up to 36% of all browsers, with more coming soon. In 2018, Microsoft announced AV1 playback on Windows 10 device. But hardware support for AV1 encode and decode is scheduled to appear till 2022\.
