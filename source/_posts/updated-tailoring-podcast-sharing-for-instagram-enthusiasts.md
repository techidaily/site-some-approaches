In this era, social media is the best advertising site for everyone. Paid promotions are in everyone's range. We understand this. That's why we are here with you to introduce some easy ways to make your content viral.

### #1 Share podcasts as Instagram stories via podcast apps

It's beneficial to share on Instagram story to alert your audience about upcoming podcasts. Go ahead and grab the simplest way to make a story.

Here, we take an easy-to-use podcast app, [Speaker Podcast Player App](https://spreaker.page.link/mkt-player-stories), as an example to show you how to create a story by sharing a single episode or a whole podcast.

##### Step1Install the app

Launch the Spreaker Podcast Player App on your smartphone, tablet, iPhone, or iPad. If you haven't already installed it, you can do it from the [Dedicated Store page](https://spreaker.page.link/mkt-player-stories)free of cost.

* [Open](https://www.spreaker.com/podcast-app) the App Player tab.
* Or use the app to choose and start the episode you wish to share.

##### Step2Play and share the episode

The player screen provides all the controls for playing the episode and interacting with the material.

* Find the "**Share**" button and tap on it.

![tap on the share button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/share-podcast-through-spreaker-podcast-player.jpg)

##### Step3Select Instagram Story

* Choose **"Instagram stories"** from the list.

It will immediately share on Instagram and generate a Story with the episode title and cover. If the Instagram Stories option is unavailable, make sure

* You should upgrade the Spreaker App to the most recent version.
* The Instagram app should download on your phone or tablet.

![instagram story option on the spreaker podcast app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-instagram-story-for-podcast-sharing.jpg)

##### Step4Streamline the story and include the episode link

You can change the cover's size, design, and other graphic elements of the episode by this app. Remember to provide the **link** to make it simpler for your followers to play the episode with only one touch. There is an easy way to get.

**On Android:** The episode's URL transfers to your clipboard. Just add a **link sticker** to the Story and paste it.

**On iOS:** Follow these instructions:

* **Return** to the Spreaker app
* Select **"Copy Link."**
* Open Instagram once again after it has been copied to the clipboard, and
* Then add a URL Sticker by pasting the link there.

![copy link option on spreaker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/copy-link-option-on-spreaker.jpg)

##### Step5Share Instagram Story

Your Story will then add the Link and be prepared for public viewing. Your story will be published if you tap on it. For 24 hours, your Story will appear in your followers' newsfeeds.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can also share a complete podcast by checking for the share button on the podcast screen rather than the player screen.

![share instagram story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/share-a-complete-podcast-on-instagram-story.jpg)

### #2 Upload a snippet of the podcast

The ideal strategy is to make a snippet and share it. This is the best way to post video podcasts on Instagram. You must perform the following:

##### Step1Download podcast

First of all, **download** the podcast or screen record it.

##### Step2Trim the part

You should **trim** the area you wish to post.

##### Step3Share and publish

Select "**Share**" and then publish Link. Share the **snippet** with multiple features.

##### Step4Caption of snippet

* Insert a caption (i.e., Whole Episode: Link in bio).

![snippet of podcast on instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/snippet-of-podcast-on-instagram.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can trim off any video segment**.** You may share videos longer than 60 seconds on Instagram thanks to the "**IGTV**" feature.

### #3 Post your podcast on the Instagram feed

To post a podcast on the Instagram feed, you must ensure that your feed looks attractive and the podcast post has good audio results. For this, keep in mind the following tips.

##### Tip 1\. Create a Stunning feed

A feed of your podcast Instagram page should look pleasing. Curate it to make people want to know what your next steps are, whether they are vivid, elegant, or fun, but most importantly, give it your own unique flair.

You must think of a situation in which a visitor would quickly be able to identify a post as being published by you based only on your unique syntax.

##### Tip 2\. Quality audio content

Instagram is a visual platform that attracts an audience more by sound quality and presentation of a post. You are promoting your podcast on the Instagram post; for this, your post should have pleasant highlights of the Podcast.

Highlights of the podcast should contain the main purpose of the podcast and some clicks of guests.

##### Tip 3\. Color scheme of Instagram feed

Here, choosing colors for your podcast's brand will be quite helpful. Why? So when making visuals for your feed, you will continue to utilize that color scheme. Consider the feelings you want your account to convey.

![color scheme for instagram feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/color-scheme-for-instagram-feed.jpg)

For example, you may choose green and earth tones for a cottagecore podcast about rural life instead of a crime podcast, which would work well with mysterious, dark colors.

![Wondershare Filmora 12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png)

##### Tip 4\. Post consistently

In a nutshell, consistency is important with Instagram. There is consistency when it comes to how frequently, when, and what kind of content you post. Your posts should ideally be made regularly enough for your followers to know when to expect new content from you.

### #4 Post your video podcasts to IGTV

Instagram just introduced the IGTV function, which allows users to submit movies longer than **60 seconds**. This is an excellent spot to provide a longer preview of what's to come if you currently capture videos about your podcast.

You can also publish a blooper reel or other content that will support the blooper video or other content that will attract your audience to pay attention to what you have to say.

![video podcast on igtv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/video-podcast-on-igtv.jpg)

**Did You Know?** Most Instagram users log in regularly, and one-third of fans watch multiple times daily, making IGTV the ideal medium for promoting your podcast.

### #5 Paste the episode link in your Instagram bio

Because Instagram is a visual medium, your bio is the only area on Instagram where you may include a personal link. Use this instead of the restricted messaging options available (such as post captions, etc.).

Include a call to action asking your followers to visit your bio and click the link in each Instagram post you make.

![episode link in the instagram bio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/episode-link-in-the-instagram-bio.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** As you release each new episode, ensure the links are up to date so your fans can easily access them.

## Part 4\. More Choices for Promoting Podcasts on IG

You get almost all free-way tips. But now, it's time to reveal some top rankings tips to boot up in minutes. Scroll more, and you'll get hidden ways of Instagram to invest and enjoy the fruit. Let's start with this:

### 1\. Invest in sponsored content for your podcast on Instagram

Of course, having a small audience should allow you to receive views on your blog. Turning your posts into advertising will improve clickthrough rates, sophisticated targeting, and unique post styles. This is another option for posting a podcast on Instagram.

Depending on your goals, you can pay anywhere from 20 cents to $2 CPM (cost per thousand views or impressions). Your post will appear on the feeds of your chosen audience once your ad is live and running.

![sponsored content looks like](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/instagram-sponsored-content.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You'll note that advertisements are sold the same way ads for your podcast are sold.

By making your post a sponsored commercial, you may direct visitors to your website, much like the swipe-up function of Instagram Stories.

### 2\. Add hashtags to spice up your IG feed for podcasts

"**Hashtag**" was a popular term during the time social media was first being started. But learning how to utilize it effectively is helpful when marketing your company or spreading your identity to a bigger audience.

Create a unique hashtag for your podcast and use it whenever you publish or when your guests share anything connected to it. It will compile all your material into one place, directing users to all posts mentioning your podcast whenever they click on your hashtag.

![podcast has over 9m posts on instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/podcast-post-on-instagram.jpg)

**Make your hashtag**

Create a unique hashtag for your podcast and use it whenever you publish or when any of your guests share anything connected to it.

It can compile all of your material into one place, directing users to all posts mentioning your podcast whenever they click on your hashtag.

![a double dose includes their own hashtag on every post](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/podcast-hashtag-on-instagram.jpg)

**Use other Hashtags**

On the other hand, using additional hashtags demands greater planning and investigation. Such as you can choose top instagram hashtags like:

* #lifestyle
* #instagood
* #photooftheday
* #art
* #beautiful
* #photography
* #happy
* #cute
* #follow
* #nature
* #like4like
* #followme
* #fitness
* #food
* #nofilter
* #dog

## Final Words

While some of these tips could be more effective for you than others. Feel free to try different things to check what attracts and engages your target audience. Be constant in your approach at all times while adjusting your plan to see what works.
