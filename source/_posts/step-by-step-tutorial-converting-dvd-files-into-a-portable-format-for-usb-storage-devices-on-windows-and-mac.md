## How to Copy DVDs onto USB via Copy and Paste? 

**Can I copy a DVD onto a USB stick directly? Yes,** you can directly copy the contents, audio and video TS files of a DVD and paste them to a USB flash drive, as long as the DVD disc **is not copy-protected**. The DVD folder files will contain the original quality. However, it's important to note that the DVD folder files may not be supported by most devices. The process is pretty simple: 

**Step 1\.** Insert the DVD into your PC or Mac's internal or external DVD drive and don't play it. If the DVD starts to play, stop it. On Windows, Go to Start -> My Computer. Right click the drive in which you inserted the DVD. Then select 'Explore'. On Mac, go to Finder and find the DVD drive under Device. Then double-click on the DVD drive. 

**Step 2.** You will then see a Video\_TS and an Audio\_TS folder. The Video\_TS folder contains all the contents of the movie. Inside the Video\_TS folder are files labeled with IFO, BUP, and VOB extensions. The VOB files contain the audio, video, and subtitle media of the main movie. 

**Step 3\.** You copy all the DVD's contents and files. You can either copy the Video\_TS folder to your computer, which can be played by VLC Media Player and some other players, or extract the VOB files one by one. 

**Step 4.** After you transfer the Video\_TS folder or VOB files of the DVD to your local computer, plug your USB memory stick. Then copy the DVD content to the USB flash drive from your computer. Make sure the USB has enough space as an exact copy of a DVD can take **4.5GB**.

**When copying DVDs to a USB, please:**

* When you copy DVDs to USB sticks, **it's not a good idea to set the USB flash drive as the output folder directly.** You can copy the DVD to the local drive on your Mac or PC, then put the DVD video to the USB flash drive in the same manner as moving any other file.
* Make sure your computer has sufficient free space to store the temporary files during the conversion process.
* Make sure your USB flash drive has sufficient free space to store the copied DVD video.
* Keep your USB drive and DVD drive clean to prevent read or write errors.
* If you encounter any issues during conversion, such as Error 0x80030309, update the DVD to USB converter to the latest version, or enable the Safe Mode on the right lower corner of the DVD to USB converter. It's most likely caused by an advanced copy protection.

_Notice: We only advocate using this DVD ripper to transfer protected DVDs to USB flash drive under the concept of Fair Use and do not encourage any illegal reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content. Please abide by the local DVD copyright law before doing it._

The "best" format depends on what you care about the most. Below are some examples: 

* To save a copy of DVD collections on a USB drive to protect the original discs, you may want to keep the best possible quality. ISO image, MPEG-2, and MKV are the top choices. Note that they also take up quite a large space.
* To transfer a DVD to USB sticks for easier playback on TVs from Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, LG, etc., you can choose MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV.
* To copy a DVD to USB memory sticks for later editing or streaming, MP4 is recommended.

**2\. How to copy a CD to a USB flash drive?**

What if you want to copy the music from a CD to a USB stick to play on your car or home stereo, how to transfer CD to a USB? Unlike DVDs, you don't need extra software to copy a CD. On Windows, you can use the Rip Settings in Windows Media Player. On Mac, you can directly open the CD in the Finder and copy the music. 

**3\. How to copy DVD to USB bootable?**

To create a bootable USB from a software DVD, follow the steps below:

1. Download and install a bootable USB drive creation tool, such as Rufus or UNetbootin.
2. Insert the USB drive into your computer and run the bootable USB drive creation tool.
3. Follow the prompts to create a bootable USB drive. Make sure to select the appropriate options for your computer's operating system and architecture.
4. Once the bootable USB drive is created, insert the DVD into your computer's DVD drive.
5. Open File Explorer and navigate to the DVD drive. Select all the files and folders on the DVD and copy them to the bootable USB drive.

**4\. How to select the best USB to copy DVDs?**

Before copying DVDs to a USB flash drive, you should choose the right USB. Below are several things to pay attention to:

* **USB Device Size:** A USB should be large enough to store the output DVD video. The size of a ripped DVD video varies based on the formats you choose. For example, if you copy a DVD to ISO image or MKV using MakeMKV or DVD Shrink, the size of the DVD video is almost the same as the original DVD. That's about 4GB for a full movie. Then you will need a large-size USB to copy your DVD collections. You can also choose to convert DVDs to smaller video formats such as MP4\.
* **Write/Read Speed:** It doesn't make too mcuh difference if you only need to copy a couple of DVDs to a USB. But if there are tons of DVD videos to be copied to a USB flash drive, you'd better get USB 3.0 and higher to transfer the movies faster.
* **USB Device System:** There are different USB file formats, such as NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, HFS+, APFS, and EXT 2, 3, 4\. What you need to know is that some USB formats have limits on the size of an individual file. For example, if you choose to copy DVDs to USB in ISO or MKV, don't use FAT32, which doesn't allow a single video larger than 4GB.

**5\. Why do you need to copy DVDs to a USB flash drive?**

According to a survey focused on 30 - 60-year-old men, the main reasons that DVD owners want to transfer DVDs to a USB include:

* 37% respondents say it's much more convenient to watch DVD movies on TV and Projector Screen via USB.
* 21% participants choose to rip DVD to USB flash drive just because USB is small and light-weight, easy to carry when they go out for a trip.
* Among them, 18% interviewees regard it as a primary choice to share DVD content to another computer.
* Some can't empty enough room to save numerous discs. So they'd like to copy DVD disc to USB for backup and management. They account for 15% of the total.
* The rest insists that it's better to protect their DVDs from physical damages. They just need plug in USB to play DVDs instead of inserting disc each time.

**6** **. Can I copy copy-protected DVDs to USB?** 

Most commercial DVDs are copy-protected, which can make copying them more challenging. Some software tools are able to bypass these protections, such as MacX DVD Ripper Pro, MakeMKV, and DVD Shrink. 

**7\. How do I copy multiple DVDs to a single USB drive?**

You can copy multiple DVDs to a USB flash drive by creating separate folders for each DVD on the drive. But you need to ensure you have enough storage space for all the DVDs you want to copy. A standard single-layer DVD typically requires around 4.7 GB, while a dual-layer DVD can use up to 8.5 GB. If you copy DVD to USB in ISO image, then a single-layer DVD will take as big as the original 4.7GB. Then a 128GB USB can store about 25 DVDs. 

**8\. Is there a risk of losing DVD quality when copying to USB?** 

The quality of the copied DVD depends on the software and settings you use. For example, if you copy DVD to USB in ISO image or MKV, you can often achieve near-original quality. 

**9\. Can I legally copy DVDs to a USB drive?**

The legality of copying DVDs to a USB flash drive on Mac/PC varies by country and the specific circumstances. Generally, making a personal backup copy for personal use may be allowed in some regions, but copying for distribution or commercial purposes is typically prohibited.
