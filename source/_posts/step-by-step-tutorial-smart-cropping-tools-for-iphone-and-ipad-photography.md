## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Smart Cropping Tools for iPhone & iPad Photography

### Key Takeaways

* Open the image you want to crop in the Photos app, then tap "Edit" and select "Crop" from the editing toolbar.
* Drag and drop the edges to crop the image. You can also select a fixed aspect ratio or pinch and drag to enlarge or shrink the image.
* When you're finished, tap "Done" to save the cropped image. You can always revert it at a later date if you need to.

 Want to zoom into an image or cut an item out of view? It's easy to change the shape or proportions of a photo on iPhone or iPad by cropping using the Photos app. Here's how to do it.

##  Crop Images in the Photos App

 To get started, open the Photos app on your iPhone or iPad and navigate to the photo that you want to crop. In the top-right corner, tap the "Edit" button. This will take you to the photo editing view. In the bottom toolbar, tap the Crop button (it looks like two overlapping corners with arrows around it).

 A white frame will appear around the image, with the four corners highlighted. Drag and drop from any corner or edge to crop the image. You can also drag and drop from the middle of the image to move it inside the frame or pinch to enlarge or shrink it. You can do this from all corners. Lift your finger to see the cropped image.

 When you're happy, tap the "Done" button to save your cropped image. You can now [share the photo with your friends](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/definitive-guide-for-resolving-dauntless-pc-stability-issues-and-crashes/) using the Share button in the bottom toolbar or just keep the cropped version in your photo library for yourself.

##  How to Crop Photos to a Set Aspect Ratio

 You can crop the image using a specific aspect ratio as well. This is useful if you need the photo to be a perfect square or another common aspect ratio. To do this, tap the Aspect Ratio button in the top toolbar after hitting the Crop button (it looks like multiple overlapping aspect ratios).

 You can now choose the aspect ratio you want by swiping along the bottom. You'll see options such as Square, 4:3, 16:9 and so on (the aspect ratios may be reversed if you're viewing a portrait image). You can also stick to the Original aspect ratio, go Freeform to choose your own, or switch between Portrait and Landscape formats.

 Even after selecting the aspect ratio, you can continue to crop the image as before. The difference is that now, the aspect ratio will be locked. When you're happy, tap the "Done" button to save your cropped image.

##  How to Undo the Crop

 All edits in the Photos app are non-destructive. This means that you can revert any photo to its original state if you performed the original change or edit on your device. If you want to restore the photo that you just cropped, open the photo in the Photos app again.

 Tap the "Edit" button in the top-right corner. Then, tap the red "Revert" button. In the pop-up, choose the "Revert to Original" option.

Close 

 And that's it. The photo will be back to its original form!
