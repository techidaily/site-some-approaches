## IPhone 10'S Milestone Moment - Join MacXDVD’s Limited-Time Sweepstakes & Win Exclusive Rewards!

## MacXDVD Airs iPhone 10th Anniversary Celebration with Time-Limited Giveaway and Contest Prizes 

July 03, 2017

_iPhone turns 10 this week, for which reason MacXDVD kicks off an unheard-of iPhone 10th anniversary event featuring a survey contest and a giveaway of its ace product MacX MediaTrans. The celebrating activity will last until July 20\._ 

This week marks iPhone's 10-year birthday. On the heel of the epic milestone, MacXDVD cheerfully puts the unheard-of iPhone 10th anniversary event in the limelight. It's a once-in-a-decade feast, from which unlimited copies of MacX Video Converter Pro with fairly fast video converting function will be gifted for free on condition of joining an iPhone survey. At the same time, 10,000 free copies of the tiptop MacX MediaTrans are given away unconditionally so that iPhone users will make a bee-line to safe data backup. 

The celebrating activity will last for half a month and end on July 20\. Additional and detailed information about the iPhone 10th anniversary event is available at: <https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/iphone-10th-anniversary-looking-back-evolution.htm>

It has been 10 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the first Jesus iPhone that completely transformed the smartphone landscape. As of now, totally 15 models have been released and more than 1 billon iPhones have been sold worldwide since 2007\. Strikingly, iPhone has revolutionized Apple's business to a great extent, accounting for 63% of sales. These milestones are testaments to Apple's commitment to unremitting innovation. "At the time when iPhone turns 10, rather than focusing on nostalgia and bragging the glory achievement, we just want to commemorate the pivotal 10-year mark in the form of survey contest and giveaway so that Apple fans are on a roll to win gifts." said Jack, CEO of MacXDVD Software. 

Below are the two promotions to celebrate the epic milestone: 

**1\. An iPhone Survey Contest**  
 In light of the 10th anniversary for Apple iPhone, MacXDVD launches the online survey contest titled "Which is the most classic iPhone for you?" While there, all participants will get a free copy of [MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) as long as they join the quick survey. 

Excitingly, MacXDVD prepares 3 iTunes Gift Cards ($50, $25, $15) and makes it really easy to win! Just share the[iPhone 10th anniversary event](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) on Facebook and 3 lucky winners will be picked up, depending on the number of Facebook Likes. The Contest result will be announced on July 20, 2017\. 

**2\. Time-Limited Giveaway of MacX MediaTrans**   
The [iPhone 8](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is the symbol of the 10th anniversary of Apple smartphones. It's believed the tech colossus raises the bar higher for this gadget. "Media sites like CNET and MacWorld believe in a dramatic redesign and dyed-in-the-wool upgrade for it, say edge-to-edge OLED display, wireless charging, homeless button, iris scanning, to name a few," added Jack, "but we believe in a must-do data backup mechanism before you upgrade to iPhone 8."

Resultantly, MacXDVD prepares 10,000 [MacX MediaTrans](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) license codes for giveaway, wishing Apple users won't go anymore awry when they make the big switch and make a safe data backup and transferring. The free gift gives customers full control over photos, music, TV shows, movies, 4k videos, ringtones, ebooks, and everything entertaining including iTunes purchases. With full support of all models of iPhone (7), iPad (Pro) and iPod Touch, it allows to manage, transfer and [backup all iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) contents, with no worry about iPhone space woes or data loss.
