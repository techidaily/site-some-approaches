## Mac Graphics Revolution: Top 10 Freeware Drawings

When it comes to flawless functioning, especially in graphics designing, animations, and most importantly, during the rendering process, nothing can beat the smoothness and speed of a Mac computer. With that said, if you are a creative designer, you would hate the frequent system crashes that Windows PCs have, and most certainly, you wouldn’t like the time the non-Mac computers waste when your head is full of the creative idea.

Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some **free drawing software for Mac** that you can use as a beginner or a professional graphic designer.

## Part 1: 10 Best Drawing Apps for Mac \[Free & Paid\]

Below are some **best drawing programs for Mac, free** and paid. The list also includes the name of a built-in app in macOS called Preview that is more or less similar to MS Paint that Windows operating systems have.

It is noteworthy that the applications listed below are in no particular order as far as their working efficiency or flexibility is concerned, and you are free to pick any software that you find best as per your business or personal needs.

Although we have tried our best to provide the latest information about the programs available in this writing, you are highly encouraged to check the vendors’ official websites to get the most updated version and corresponding details of the applications you are interested in.

The built-in **free drawing software for Mac**, Preview, has some markup tools that allow you to annotate and draw shapes on the images. The step-by-step instructions are given below explain how this can be done with the least effort:

Step 1: Reveal Markup Toolbar

Right-click the photo you want to edit on Mac, go to **Open With**, and click **Preview (default)**. Next, click the **Show Markup Toolbar** from the upper-right corner of the interface to get the **Markup Toolbar** under the standard toolbar.

Step 2: Use the Shapes Tool

Click the **Shapes** icon in the **Markup Toolbar**, and select your preferred shape tool from the available options. Drag the automatically added shape to reposition it to your preferred location on the image. Optionally, use the scaling handles to resize the body as needed. Next, click the **Border Color** and **Fill Color** icons and select your preferred colors for the shape’s outline and background color.

Step 3: Use the Text Tool
