Locate the **Start** icon at the bottom left corner of your screen and click on it.

![start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-000.png)

Select **Settings** from the options that comes up, and the interface below will come up:

![settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-001.png)

Step2 Next, click on **Sounds** to configure some defaults
