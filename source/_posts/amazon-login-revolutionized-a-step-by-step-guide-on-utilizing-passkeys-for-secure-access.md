## Amazon Login Revolutionized: A Step-by-Step Guide on Utilizing Passkeys for Secure Access

###### [Read update](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-three-foundational-elements-for-powerful-facebook-ad-headlines/) 

* **_Amazon Announces Passkey Support_**

 Amazon is one of the first major retailers to offer [passkey sign-in](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-location-on-life360-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/). You no longer need a password to log into the Amazon website, as you can save a passkey directly to your phone or computer instead. Sadly, Amazon's passkey implementation is a little clunky, and Amazon's apps still lack passkey support.

**_Amazon Announces Passkey Support_** 

 Amazon formally announced passkey support in a [press release](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-passwordless-sign-in-passkey) on October 23rd. The company is also extending passkey functionality to the iOS Amazon Shopping app. Android support will come at a later date. 

 Passkeys offer a more secure and convenient login experience than traditional passwords. Because passkeys are saved to your device, they don't need to be memorized, and they can be triggered by typing in a PIN, using Face ID, or scanning your fingerprint. Also, if someone wants to hack into your passkey-protected accounts, they need to physically access your phone or computer. To enable passkey sign-in on Amazon, open the [Your Account page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/homepage.html?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000729&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fyou-can-now-sign-into-amazon-with-passkeys%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) on the Amazon desktop website and click the "Login & security" card. Under your phone number, you'll find the option to add a passkey to your account. Amazon will generate a passkey that is automatically saved to Windows Hello, iCloud Keychain, or any third-party passkey manager you use (such as [1Password](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-11-pro-passcode-without-computer-by-drfone-ios/)).

 It's great to see passkeys on the Amazon website. In theory, this should accelerate passkey adoption and get us on track for a passwordless future. But Amazon's passkey implementation isn't great. None of the Amazon apps (including the Amazon shopping app) support passkey sign-in, and Amazon still forces users to type in a 2FA verification code when using passkeys.

 Plus, as [Corbado](https://www.corbado.com/blog/amazon-passkeys-launch) notes, passkeys are domain-specific. A passkey made for amazon.com won't work on the German-language amazon.de domain, and so on. European users who like to shop on other countries' Amazon listings (to find good prices) must create a passkey for each domain (or simply rely on a username and password when visiting other Amazon domains).

 Of course, Amazon isn't forcing anybody to use passkeys, and you're free to sign in with a username and password after setting up passwordless login. As for Amazon's funky passkey implementationâ€”well, things will improve with time. Amazon hasn't even announced passkey support in a press release, blog post, or earnings call. This feature is fresh, new, and still in the works.
