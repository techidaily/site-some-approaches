**RipIt** surely leaves you deep impression for its simplicity. But it indeed is not your best option to digitize DVDs right now. Google "Ripit" and there is no official ripit website result. The top results come from Mac software download sites where you can find, free download and buy Ripit with its latest version 1.6.9 (updated on June, 2016). And users reflect that its developer The Little App Factory seems to shut down, serial number unavailable.
