 If you don’t use a printer anymore and wish to remove it, or you want to uninstall and reinstall a printer to fix its problems, both Windows 11 and Windows 10 make it super easy to uninstall printers. We’ll show you how to do that using two graphical and one command line method.

##  Three Ways to Uninstall a Printer

 There are three different ways to remove a printer from a Windows PC. 

1. If you’re only looking to remove the printer’s connection from your PC and without deleting the printer’s drivers, use the Settings app method. This method ensures the selected printer doesn’t appear in any print dialog boxes.
2. If you want to completely remove a printer (and the associated drivers), use the Device Manager method. This is helpful if you’re [troubleshooting issues with the printer](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-realme-gt-5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).
3. The third method is a command line method that removes the printer’s connection from your PC, just like the Settings app does.

##  Uninstall the Printer Using the Settings App 

 If you’re on a Windows 11 PC, head into Settings > Bluetooth & Devices > Printers & Scanners. On Windows 10, navigate to Settings > Devices > Printers & Scanners.

 PowerShell has removed the specified printer. You can run **Get-Printer** again to confirm that it has been removed. 

##  Delete the Printer's Installed Apps

 Most printers (if not all) install their own manufacturer apps when you add a printer to your PC. If you’ve gotten rid of your printer for good, you should remove these installed apps as well. Here’s how to do that.

###  On Windows 11

 Open Settings using Windows+i and navigate to Apps > Installed apps.

!['Installed apps' highlighted in Windows 11 Settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/10-installed-apps-windows-11.jpg) 

 Find your printer’s app on the list. Next to the app, click the three dots and choose "Uninstall."

!['Uninstall' highlighted for a printer app in Windows 11 Settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/11-delete-printer-app-windows-11.jpg) 

 Select "Uninstall" in the prompt.

###  Remove the Deleted Printer’s Leftover Registry Keys

 Open the Start Menu, search for **Registry Editor**, and launch the utility.
