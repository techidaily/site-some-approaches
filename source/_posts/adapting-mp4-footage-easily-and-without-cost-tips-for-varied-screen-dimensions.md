## What Presses You to Crop MP4 Videos

Particularly, the reasons why you need to [crop MP4 video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) are mainly owing to the following.

**1\. To remove black boarders from MP4 video.**   
As we've mentioned, the arising of the tiresome black bars stems from the different requirements of video dimensions of different devices. Thus to get rid of the black boarders, you have to crop out your video to adapt to the different screen sizes. For example, you've recorded a couple of MP4 videos with GoPro Hero 4 in 1920 \* 1080\. As you're trying to watch them on your 2017 Macbook Pro with 2880 \* 1800 wide screen monitor, there are black boarders. Just then, you're advisable to crop the MP4 to 1728\*1080, or 1.6:1 to make your video best fit the Macbook screen size. 

**2\. To get a close-up of your video.**   
There are also times that your need remove the unwanted portion of a video image and focus on a certain area. For instance, when the recording distance is too far away even if you've zoomed in, you can crop the recorded MP4 video to get a close-up of your target area and erase non-essential. 

**3\. To reduce MP4 video file size.**   
Yes, you read that right: cropping MP4 could [reduce your video to smaller size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Cropping allows you to change the height-to-width ratio of an image and simultaneously free up the space usage of the area that you've cropped out. In brief, people are used to leaving a white space when recording videos like the blue sky and the near ground. If you cut off the meaningless white space on the image, the video size will be compressed greatly. 

**4\. To change the aspect ratio.**   
Changing the aspect ratio is also a main cause for MP4 cropping. What we do most is to [change 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) meet the screens of high-definition LCD monitors and TVs. But there are also some other norms of height-to-width ratio, such as vertical video (formats 4:5, 2:3, 16:9) can be most engaging for Facebook videos in mobile, Instagram accepts 1.91:1 Landscape, 1:1 Square and 4:5 Vertical videos and YouTube's built-in video editor allows you to crop YouTube video to 4:3, 16:9, and 24:10\. Thus, if you'd like upload your iPhone recorded video in 4:3 aspect ratio to Facebook and Instagram, crop iPhone MP4 video according to your need.
