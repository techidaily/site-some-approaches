When the results appear, tap on your chosen item to view more details. A summary of the podcast's topic, ratings, genre, and other information is included in the additional details. The most recent episode of that podcast should be the one that appears at the top. Earlier episodes can be listened to by scrolling down and selecting the one you want to hear.

You can choose to subscribe or unfollow the podcast you're listening to. By subscribing to a podcast, you can stay updated on new content and forthcoming episodes.

## Why Can't I Play a Podcast on My iPhone?

If your iPhone is not playing podcasts, there's usually a problem with downloading or syncing the podcast with other devices.

There are several reasons why this process can be interrupted or unavailable. For example, an unstable Internet connection or any issue with the podcast servers. Another reason for the podcast not playing could be a bug or a misconfiguration of the podcast app. The Apple Podcasts app doesn't provide many error warnings. It is uncommon and can be challenging to debug.

### Fixes for Apple Podcast App Issues

1. On your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, check the volume. Make sure the volume isn't muted and is loud enough.

3. Ensure the appropriate audio output is chosen.
4. Redownload the podcast after erasing it from your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. When downloaded, files can sometimes become corrupt.
