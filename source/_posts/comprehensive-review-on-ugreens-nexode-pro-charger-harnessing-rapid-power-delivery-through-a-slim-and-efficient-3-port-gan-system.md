## Made From Aluminum, This Charger Delivers a Premium Build for Your On-the-Go Power Kit

![The Ugreen Nexode Pro 100W USB C Wall Charger plugged into an outlet](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/53335456287_4a5585bbe2_o-1.jpg) 

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

 While many chargers these days are made with plastic housings, like Apple’s own USB-C chargers, Ugreen went with a more premium material here. While it might weigh a bit more than [Apple’s 96W USB-C charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX0J2AM/A/96w-usb-c-power-adapter), Ugreen’s 100W Nexode Pro unit is smaller in two dimensions than what Apple has to offer. All this while delivering three ports, instead of just one. The housing of the charger is aluminum, delivering a premium aesthetic and feel for the charger. You’ll find that the ports themselves are surrounded by plastic, but that’s the only external surface of this charger that isn’t made of metal. The more premium build also makes you feel like the charger can handle anything.

 I have no question that this charger can just get thrown in my laptop bag or my wife’s purse and easily survive coming into contact with anything else that’s in there; something that plastic chargers don’t always exude with a less premium feel.

##  With up to 100W Charging and Multiple Outputs, You Can Power a 14-Inch M3 Max MacBook Pro at Full Speed

![The ports on the Ugreen Nexode Pro 100W USB C Wall Charger](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/53336564083_4be46ac68a_o.jpg) 

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

 While Apple’s latest 16-inch MacBook Pro lineup requires 140W, the smaller [14-inch M3 Pro or Max MacBook Pro](https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-your-first-step-into-youtube-creating-an-engaging-channel/) can fast charge with just 96 watts of power. This means that, when being the sole device plugged in, Ugreen’s 100W Nexode Pro charger can fast charge Apple’s compact, yet powerful, laptop. With the power efficiency of the M-series of processors, you can even have multiple devices plugged in and still power your laptop.

 When all three USB-C ports are in use, you’ll get 65W out of the top port and 5V3A from the other USB-C port and USB-A port. Flipping the script, when using both USB-C ports, you’ll get 65W from the top and 30W from the one below. And, when using the top USB-C and the USB-A, you’ll get 65W and 22.5W respectively. The only downside here is that you can't really get a decent amount of speed from all three ports at one time. Sure, the top USB-C port is 65W no matter what, but the second USB-C port regulates down to 5V3A when all three ports are in use. While this does equate to 15W of power, which is enough to charge your iPhone and most iPads, it does limit its usage should you need all three ports at one time.

 All of this combined to provide a charger that made it easy to power my 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPhone, and Apple Watch all at the same time. When traveling, this charger will be great to have on hand as it only needs one wall outlet to power my entire mobile kit at one time.

##  Half the Size of Apple’s 96W Power Adapter With More Capability

![The prongs of the Ugreen Nexode Pro 100W USB C Wall Charger folded in](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/53336670714_286c1c5876_o.jpg)

 I have already touched on the fact that this charger is pretty compact, but I want to expand on that a bit more. While it’s slightly heavier than Apple’s official 96W charger, you’ll find that Ugreen’s 100W Nexode Pro charger is quite compact in every other aspect. It’s nearly half the size of Apple’s 96W charger, making it far more compact and easier to bring with you on vacation or even just to work. The one thing to remember is that the prongs fold into the charger, but that part is not modular like Apple’s official offering which has an available cord add-on.

##  Should You Buy the Ugreen 100W Nexode Pro Charger?

 If you’re looking for a premium charger to power multiple devices at one time, then [Ugreen's Nexode Pro 100W 3-Port GaN Fast Charger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCVQB7MY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001377&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-pro-100w-3-port-gan-fast-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is a great choice. Apple’s official 96W USB-C comes in at [$79](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX0J2AM/A/96w-usb-c-power-adapter), and the dual port 35W charger from Apple costs [$59](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNWM3AM/A/35w-dual-usb-c-port-compact-power-adapter). Meanwhile, this brand-new Ugreen 100W Nexode Pro charger, which has three outputs and delivers 100W of power, comes in at just $74.99\. For less than the cost of Apple’s official 96W charger, you can power your 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and Apple Watch at one time.

 This makes Ugreen’s latest charger a highly recommended power adapter in my book. With a solid build quality, multiple outputs, and a compact form factor, you’ll find that this charger will be a go-to when traveling for sure. Plus, whenever you’re at home, it lets you keep multiple plugs within arm’s reach when at your desk or bedside.
