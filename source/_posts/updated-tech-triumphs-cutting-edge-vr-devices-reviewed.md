* VirZoom

 The VirZoom has a unique apartment-friendly magnitude, but it still priced at $399.95 only, on balance with some other home fitness apparatuses. Along with a headset and also a computer capable of using it, however, that ticket could be as costly as $1500\. That is a very big asset for the customers whose Wii Fit is more likely gathering dirt at the house of their parents. Fortunately, Honey man says a gymnasium form of VirZoom will also be ready in the year 2017.

* Widerun virtual biking

 Visualize yourself biking in the city of San Francisco in the bay, on the Olympic racing track as well, and on the snowy trail on the Alps, and in any city as well around the world!

## 3\. VR Treadmills

 Virtual reality treadmills and gloves are changing the life of people to another level. You can now do exercise in virtual reality running on beautiful sites all over the world. Let’s have a look on some of the products.

* Cyberith Virtualizer

 A lighter and extra gorgeous option. The stage here is less immense, and phases are pursued by gesture sensors. Squatting actions can be achieved more ordinary due to the option to lean on one knee, deprived of endangering to hurt it. The construction itself is more moveable, which makes it more beautiful, particularly in view of its proportions. Although its official price is unknown yet because mass production of this product has not been started yet.
