### Fix 2: Direct3D Acceleration

 There might be something wrong with your DirectX settings. To see if this is the culprit, go to**DirectX Diagnostic Tool** to check if all your DirectX features are working normally (especially**Direct3D Acceleration**).

 1) Type**dxdiag** in the search bar and hit**Enter** .

 2) Go to the**Display** tab and check if**Direct3D Acceleration** is Enabled.

**Note:** If you have more than one video adapter, check each Display tab in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.

 3) If they are all working perfectly, then you can skip to the**[next fix](https://bluettide.pxf.io/ekmjb2)** to solve your problem.

 Alternatively, you can go to**Control Panel** \>**Programs and Features** , then from the sidebar click**Turn Windows features on or off** (or**add/remove Windows Features**).

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/turn-on-DirectPlay.jpg)

 If that doesn’t work then you’ll need to find the**DX9 runtime installer** . ie.**DirectX folder**

### Fix 4: Reinstall DirectX Installer

 You may get the**Unable to initialize DirectX 9 device** error because certain DirectX files are missing. Here is how to fix it:

 1) Go to Microsoft’s **[DirectX End-User Runtimes download site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)**  and download Microsoft’s DirectX installer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/download.jpg)

 _This is the only officially supported way to check if the correct DirectX files are currently installed._

 2) Open the**dxwebsetup.exe** file and follow the onscreen instructions to install the software on your computer.

 3) Any missing DirectX files will be replaced by now. Restart your computer and test the issue.

 4) If the annoying error still sticks with you, then you need to find the**DirectX folder** in your game installation folder. Then run the game’s special DirectX installer executable file, generally named as**DXSETUP.exe** .

 Let’s take Grand Theft Auto V for example:  
  
 Go to Steam > SteamApps > Common > GTA V > \_CommonRedist > DirectX > Jun2010 > DXSETUP

### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 Circumstances are there are other conflicting applications that prevent your game from working properly. To see if that’s your problem, try performing a clean boot.

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, and type**msconfig** in the box, and hit**Enter** to open**System Configuration** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/msconfig.jpg)

 2) Click the**Service** s tab and check the**Hide all Microsoft services** box, then click**Disable all** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/disable-all.jpg)

 3) Then click the**Startup** tab and select**Open Task Manager** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/disable-all-startups.png)

5) Restart your PC and launch your game again.

 If the error message is gone, then congrats! However, you’ll need to find out the problematic software. Here is how to do it:

* Open the**System Configuration** again.
* Enable services and applications that you’ve disabled one by one until you find the problematic one.
* After enabling each startup application, you need to restart your computer again to find the conflicting one.
* Once you find out the problematic software, you may need to uninstall or disable it to avoid running into the same issue in the future.

### Good to go?

 Hopefully, one of the fixes above fixed your**Unable to initiate DirectX 9 device** problem. But if none of these worked for you, you can verify your game files in Steam or clean reinstall your game to fix the issue.
