To figure out that, below we list several leading competitors in the fight of Apple Watch vs Android Wear.   

### No.1 Motorola Moto 360

Despite being one of the originally-released round Android watches, Moto 360 remains the most well-received smart watch so far, and thus becomes one of the most formidable rivals of Apple Watch. With the platform improvement, more features have been added and more color options are available. It's got all the advantages of Android Wear for the price of $250.

## Part 3 - Disadvantages: Major Apple Watch Problems

With so many advantages of Apple Watch (Series 4), to decide whether or not to spend your money, you'd better have a look at Apple Watch Series 4 shortcomings.

 **1\. Apple Watch Disadvantages - Battery**

As we mentioned above, Apple Watch Series 4 keeps the 18 hours of battery life, the same as Series 3, which is a downside from Apple Watch upgrade for some sports enthusiasts who ask for longer batterly life. How to improve Apple Watch battery life still remains to be one of the top concerns.

 **2\. Apple Watch Price Is Ridiculous High**

Apple finally answer the question "How much will the Apple Watch cost?" And the Apple Watch's price is way higher than we were expecting to pay. Those days most of the chatter about this Apple smart watch revolves around the eye-wateringly expensive Apple Watch price. Well, the price for Apple Watch starts at $349 and goes up to $17,000\. The differences in Apple Watch prices are down to the metal and glass of the watch. If its functionality lives up to its billing? With such an outrageously high price, even those dazzling Apple Watch advantages can hardly persuade users to buy one. 

 **3\. Dependent on iPhone**

Leaving aside the high Apple Watch price, another big problem with this Apple smart phone is that it's not a stand-alone devices. The watch can't be fully functional unless an iPhone is connected. This limits the benefits of Apple Watch that users can enjoy to a great extent. To put it another way, without an iPhone, you can only check the time. If you have already owned an iPhone, why you need an extra device, which bring rather limited functions compared with iPhone? Additionally, the 18-hour battery life as advertised is no significant improvement over other smart watches.
